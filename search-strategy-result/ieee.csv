It has also brought many security risks. The centralized data storage poses the risk of data leakage. With the breakout of the Novel Coronavirus, it is common for schools to import the health management tools such as the body temperature monitoring system. If these health data are integrated together, it can facilitate school authorities to track students' health status, but centralized management has the risk of widespread data leakage. We propose a decentralized, personal cloud data model. The history of a student's health data will be stored only in each student's personal online datastore managed by Edu Pod, which is a student health information data management application that provides various services and mechanisms to secure the personal data in the Pod. By decentralizing the data to the students' individual Pods, it prevents the occurrence of large-scale data leaks by centralized management. We apply this model to the Campus Health Information System (CHIS) which we are studying in. The student's temperature data collected by face recognition will eventually be stored only in his or her personal Pod, which is a portable educational information storage unit, and the student can share the data with the university and any third-party health management software. The application of a centralized personal cloud data model can help students' personal data not be limited to a centralized server farm and can control their personal data more freely. It can also avoid information leakage and help to protect personal privacy at the same time.","","978-1-6654-2174-4","10.1109/DASC-PICom-CBDCom-CyberSciTech52372.2021.00146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9730502","Decentralization;Personal online datastore;Decentralized authorization;Data transfer;IoT","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Temperature distribution;Clouds;Learning (artificial intelligence);Big Data;Data models","","4","","14","IEEE","15 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the factors contributing to the issues that arise during the migration process is the organization’s inclination to follow trends and its limited understanding of microservices. This study aims to develop a set of readiness criteria that could serve as the basis for readiness evaluation. We analyze the proposed criteria using the Technology-Organizational-Environment (TOE) and Human-Organization-Technology-fit (HOT-Fit) framework. We also conducted an interview study using the Delphi method with ten experts to refine the proposed criteria. The participating experts are experienced in executing architectural migrations. The following criteria are quantified using the Analytic Network Process (ANP), a method within Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). We conducted a case study on the government’s back-office application to evaluate the result of the built-in criteria. The findings indicate that organizational, human, environmental, and technological variables significantly impact the readiness level in migration decision-making. In the organizational context, leadership commitment is the most crucial criterion. While in the human context, the programmer’s ability is critical. In the context of the environment, user satisfaction is vital. In the technological context, the quality of information and security are paramount.

However, MLaaS on the massive medical data faces the challenge of privacy. Homomorphic encryption technology has been explored to assure the privacy of medical data owners in MLaaS but with the weaknesses of limited homomorphic operations and low efficiency. To alleviate these weaknesses, this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving non-collusion dualcloud (NCDC) model-based e-health information system using neural network (NN) computing. The system can not only assure medical data privacy through adopting homomorphic encryption technology but also assure NN model privacy by adding fake neurons to the NN. In addition, the proposed e-health information system also has the following advantages: (i) Simple key generation. (ii) No constraint on the size of medical data to be encrypted.

Common standards can achieve interoperability, deciphering the meaning of the data exchanged. The general criterion that can be used is FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). Data exchange with this standard is considered adequate and efficient when using the GraphQL approach because the client efficiently manages the requests he wants according to the data schema that has been defined. In addition, the Health Information System is said to be successful if electronic medical record data is always available if you want to use it. Therefore a storage system is needed to maintain the data's existence. The blockchain-based storage method with BigchainDB can solve this problem. These three technologies (FHIR, BigchainDB and GraphQL) are expected to produce a service-based system that can be used to exchange international standard electronic medical record data and can be applied across various systems. As a result, on one server node, the time required to read data is 0.32 ms, and the time needed to insert data is 47 ms. On three server nodes, the time necessary to read data is 0.175 ms and the time required to insert data is 1430 ms.

The body temperature is recorded while face recognition is performed, and the face ID and the collected real-time body temperature are transmitted to the cloud for viewing and managing by the school. The data will be managed centrally in the cloud and will be cleaned during daily processing. In the end, the student's health data history will be stored only in their personal Pod (Personal online datastore), a decentralized personal cloud data model that prevents the risk of large-scale data leakage due to centralized management. The combination of body temperature detection and face recognition avoids substituting the presence of a real person with photos or pictures, which further enhances security. It also reduces the risk of infection prompted by human detection, which increases safety.","","978-1-6654-2174-4","10.1109/DASC-PICom-CBDCom-CyberSciTech52372.2021.00145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9730523","Face Recognition;Body Temperature Detection;Raspberry Pi;Data Transmission;Cloud Database;Internet of Things","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Cloud computing;Temperature distribution;Face recognition;Clouds;Real-time systems","","6","","9","IEEE","15 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even without moving around, a person interacts with personnel from different institutions treating him as a patient in their daily life. Each of these institutions keeps their patients’ data stored in their own information system, in an isolated way. Due to this, each patient has their data scattered among all these institutions and services with which she interacts along her life. This can complicate the take of the proper decision when the patient is under treatment. To solve this situation, new patient-centered health systems have been proposed as a replacement to the actual institution-centered ones, storing all health information of a patient into a unique global vision. However, some questions have arisen around the actual proposals, as who should store and maintain this vision of a given patient, and how should this information be made available for other systems. The proposal presented in this paper advocate for the achievement of a Personal Health Trajectory that can be useful both for patients and health professionals, using the concept of blockchains’ federation. The proposal has been validated using 5689 records from 50 different institutions, belonging to 1156 actors.","","979-8-3503-0208-0","10.1109/CCGridW59191.2023.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181155","Data integration;Data interoperability;health data;Blockchain;Web Services","Cloud computing;Conferences;Trajectory;Proposals;Personnel;Information systems","","","","26","IEEE","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study aimed at designing and prototyping a system intended to help improve maternal health in rural areas of developing nations. This can be achieved by providing a relatively easy way to monitor the health of expectant mothers remotely and provide vital information in the form of periodic tips with automatic alerts and tracking in case of missed clinical appointments. Therefore, an architecture for context awareness and an IoT-based system is proposed to improve pregnancy monitoring in Africa and thus reduce fatalities and complications. The system uses a pulse sensor, temperature sensor, and GPS module to collect data with an Arduino as the microcontroller. The collected data is sent to the cloud using the GSM module. The cloud data is stored, processed, analysed, and then sent to the health worker. In case of any health complication or an appointment is missed, the health officials are alerted in real-time.

These approaches are often inadequate in providing a detailed analysis of the attack especially because they do not have the ability to learn from sequences of features. This work presents an improved predictive analytics model using CNN with BiLSTM to improve cybersecurity in IoT connected PHIS. The CNN component performs feature extraction on spatial elements in the data received while the BiLSTM uncovers temporal dependencies and sequence of attacks, which enhance threats identification accuracy. The process of the proposed methodology includes dataset acquisition and cleansing of IoT healthcare datasets and finally, the training and testing of the model with the help of relevant parameter such as accuracy, precision, and recall values. Qualitative comparison with the baseline models also shows that the proposed hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model performs better, and it has fewer false alarms to detect a range of cyber threats.

This study proposed a medical record management system that provides a centralized location for storing and sharing patients' information. This system enables doctors and nurses to access patients' medical records quickly and easily, leading to more effective and efficient care. Additionally, it allows multiple health facilities to seamlessly access and share medical records, eliminating the need for patients to provide the same information multiple times. Furthermore, the system includes a patient referral feature, allowing patients to be referred to another health facility if their doctor is not available, while enabling the receiving health facility to access the referred patients' information. For patient information confidentiality, doctors can only view the information of patients that are assigned to them and write doctor prescriptions. Patients can also track their health, diagnosis, and prescriptions by viewing their own medical records through the system. Moreover, the system allows patients to request the official copy of their medical records from the health facility where they are registered.

To create adaptive cognitive load management systems, this article investigates the possibility of integrating wearable devices with cloud computing infrastructure. Wearable devices may gather data, process it, and analyze it to fine-tune cognitive load treatments in real-time by tapping into the storage and processing capacity of the cloud. Individuals' cognitive capacities and the needs of their specific situation may be considered via the proposed integration, which allows for individualized feedback and treatments. Cloud analytics also make it easy to aggregate data from several users, which is great for building adaptive algorithms and getting a better comprehensive understanding of how cognitive load patterns play out on a larger scale. Many fields might benefit greatly from this integration, such as healthcare, education, and workplace performance enhancement. To fully use cloud computing and wearable technologies for cognitive load management, however, issues including data protection, interoperability, and algorithm improvement must be resolved. Human performance and well-being may be improved, which can be achieved through multidisciplinary cooperation and technological improvements.","","979-8-3315-1628-4","10.1109/ICSTSDG61998.2024.11026691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11026691","Real-time monitoring;personalized feedback;Data analytics;Data privacy;Human performance;Dynamic adjustments","Productivity;Cloud computing;Data analysis;Data protection;Cognitive load;Real-time systems;Biomedical monitoring;Wearable devices;Sustainable development;Interoperability","","","","31","IEEE","17 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, an offloading decision algorithm is proposed to balance harvested and consumed energy, determining whether and how much data to offload. Second, a Stackelberg game-based differential pricing algorithm is proposed to optimize computing resource allocation for MUs and reallocate surplus resources to delay-sensitive devices. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDPS scheme. Specifically, in comparison to the existing best-performing pricing scheme, for different task arrival rates, DDPS can achieve a 5.3% decrease in average execution delay, a 1.7% increase in ES utility ($U_{server}$, which represents the payment from MUs minus penalties for discarded tasks), and a 2.1% increase in the average ratio of service for MUs.

This research was validated with a real practical use case that is presented in this paper. In order to make the information stored in different software applications of the national health system (SIS), more specifically in the Dr. Ayres de Menezes hospital, in the country of São Tomé and Príncipe, interoperable with the information systems of the clinical laboratories that support the hospital, two different applications were developed (Patient Management System and Clinical Analysis Laboratory Management System) to implement the interoperability between them. The Patient Management application requests medical exams from your Medical Appointment dashboard. The second application receives the exam request and after exams are processed and validated, the second system sends the result to the requesting application.To make the interoperability service effective, the SOAP protocol was used, which allowed the exchange of information synchronously between these two applications, allowing for faster transactions of patients' pathological data, and greater confidentiality of this same information.","","978-1-6654-9828-9","10.1109/ISSI55442.2022.9963271","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9963271","Interoperability;Information System;Clinical Analysis Laboratory Introduction","Pathology;Protocols;Hospitals;Instruments;Laboratories;Simple object access protocol;Clinical diagnosis","","","","24","IEEE","1 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving classification scheme that provides both privacy protection and improved classification accuracy in the industrial Internet. Specifically, our approach first adaptively encrypts the original steel image using a homomorphic encryption scheme. The homomorphic encryption scheme is followed by designing a convolutional neural network which can handle the encrypted images well and provide better classification accuracy. In addition, the execution efficiency of our method can be further improved under the edge computing architecture by using distributed computing with cloud-edge architecture. Experiments conducted on real image datasets of strip steel surface show that the encryption scheme not only protects the privacy of manufacturers or companies contained in the steel images and guarantees classification accuracy, but also outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency.","2837-8601","979-8-3503-0363-6","10.1109/YAC59482.2023.10401724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10401724","Privacy-preserving;Strip steel;Homomorphic encryption;Defect category detection;Convolution neural network;Edge computing","Strips;Data privacy;Computer architecture;Companies;Steel;Homomorphic encryption;Edge computing","","","","39","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern computing infrastructures with the harmony of various layers of computing paradigms (e.g., cloud/fog/edge computing) for healthcare monitoring are apparently the essential computing backbone that help access and process instantly the medical data of every single patient at the very edge of the healthcare system to combat with global or regional virus contagion. Previous studies proposed different computing system architectures for healthcare monitoring but few works considered the evaluation of pure performance of medical data transmission in a comprehensive manner. In this paper, we proposed an M/M/c/K queuing network model for the performance evaluation of an Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) infrastructure in association with a three layer cloud/fog/edge computing continuum. The model considers a life cycle of medical data from body-attached IoT sensors in edge layer all the way to local clients (e.g., local medical doctors, physicians) through fog layer and to remote clients (e.g., medical professionals, patient's family members) through cloud layer. Furthermore, we also explore the impact of the alteration in system configuration and computing capability of computing layers in two scenarios on various performance metrics. Critical performance metrics related to quality of service are evaluated in a comprehensive manner, such as (i) mean response time of medical data transmission to fog (local) clients and to cloud (remote) clients, (ii) utilization of cloud/fog/edge computing layers, (iii) service throughput, (iv) number of medical messages in a period of time, and (v) drop rate. The simulation results pinpoint bottle-neck parameters and configurations of the IoHT infrastructure's system architecture in relation to the frequency of medical data collection for health check of patients.

Timely shock treatment depends on the rapid identification of patients with potential shock, which is challenging in the busy working environment of ICU. Hypotension events are typically clinical signs of shock, which can be detected by monitoring patients’ blood pressure (BP). The monitor issues a sound alarm as soon as BP measured is below a preconfigured threshold. However, nurses have to filter out the valid hypotension events and report to the responsible intensivists. This process is error-prone due to nurses’ and intensivists’ workload and alert fatigue. Rule-based early warning systems have the potential to detect all hypotension events and filter out invalid hypotension events. Consequently, they lead to a lower workload and better performance. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the rule-based approach remains a question, especially considering the complex nature of intensive care. In order to validate the accuracy and understand the limitations of the rule-based approach, we carried out a case study in a Chinese hospital. A ruled-based system, named Shock Alert Assistant (SAA), had been developed and tested. This system screens the real-time BP of all patients every 5 minutes and sends alert messages to intensivists. In a one-month testing phase, SAA produced 619 shock early warnings for 82 patients. The SAA’s performance was compared against 126 nurses’ notes. Clinical experts checked the inconsistency of SAA and nurses’ notes and made a golden standard. Regarding SAA, the sensitivity is 87.6%, whereas the specificity is 10.7%. Among all the false-positive alerts, 52.7% are pure low systolic blood pressure without clinical meaning, which does not lead to shock. By analyzing the results, in addition to systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and medication order related to BP control should also be used to determine hypotension events.","","978-1-6654-0126-5","10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669458","clinical decision support;shock;intensive care unit;electronic alert;hypotension;blood pressure","Sensitivity;Hospitals;Electric shock;Alarm systems;Blood pressure;Real-time systems;Biomedical monitoring","","","","12","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Designing a system to monitor chronic diseases presents designers with several obstacles. Studying possible design techniques and common functionalities prolong the design process. This research focuses on helping designers to decreases the primary design steps by presenting some common functionalities and techniques. We focused on creating an understanding of Decentralization and modularity in the pervasive healthcare systems as a method to increase Interoperability in healthcare software’s for chronic diseases. We focused on these two quality attributes (Modularity and Decentralization) because the nature of chronic disease needs monitoring and continuous surveillance. Additionally, New technologies and innovation emerge for chronic disease everyday. Decentralization can be implemented by combining Blockchain and IPFS technologies and Modularity can be implemented by list of features (functionalities). We have reviewed several published healthcare systems and frameworks in this domain to do a comparative analysis of the functionality on the proposed systems and frameworks based on their similarities and differences. Therefore, we identify functionalities by using a comparative analysis of the architectural elements of each existing system and framework. Afterward, the analysis results aggregated into features list.

Typically, IoT data is stored on company servers and is at risk of being lost if non-profit projects are terminated. Moreover, due to their size and prominence, large enterprise servers often become primary targets for hackers, posing threats to user privacy and security. In this study, we designed and implemented the decentralized IoT data platform, UPOD. Adhering to a human-centric approach, UPOD aims to provide users with a platform for personal online data storage, empowering them to self-manage their data. We advocate for the use of the ActivityPub protocol, commonly applied in decentralized social networks, as UPOD's communication protocol to unify the management of UPOD and social network data. Recognizing the diverse nature of user data, we introduced the concept of virtual roles and developed an IoT data allocation mechanism. This allows users to customize data assignment to various virtual roles and decide on sharing this data with third parties. To demonstrate its feasibility, we constructed a UPOD prototype for evaluation. The UPOD system offers guidance in addressing the issue of IoT data fragmentation. The introduced concept of virtual roles allows precise control over which data is shared or revoked, ensuring only appropriate or necessary data is shared or withdrawn, safeguarding user privacy. Since UPOD provides unified storage for users' personal data, their information remains accessible even if a company's service or project ceases, ensuring the security of individual IoT data.","2837-0740","979-8-3503-0460-2","10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/Cy59711.2023.10361378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10361378","Decentralized Social Network;Human-centric;ActivityPub;UPOD;IoT","Data privacy;Protocols;Social networking (online);Source coding;Prototypes;Companies;Servers","","4","","8","IEEE","25 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are relatively few non-invasive and/or non-proprietary systems to monitor and record patient-specific lung condition in real-time. In this paper, we present a CARE network data acquisition and monitoring system (CARENet) to automate data collection and to remotely monitor patient-specific lung condition and ventilation parameters. The automated system acquires VWD from a mechanical ventilator using a data acquisition device (DAQ), stores data in network-attached storage (NAS), and processes VWDs via a data management platform (DMP) web application. The web application enables real-time and retrospective model-based monitoring and analysis of clinical MV data. In particular, CARENet provides detailed breath-by-breath patient-specific respiratory mechanics, as well as the overall trends assessing changes in patient condition. Validation testing with a retrospective data set illustrated how breath-to-breath and time-varying patient-ventilator interaction during MV can be monitored, and, in turn, can be used to guide MV treatment.

Because of issues with missing data, unclear patient identification, and excessive noise in patient information, these systems are not suitable for record linking of health data in underdeveloped nations. There is a serious concern that patients' personally identifiable information stored in electronic health records poses a threat to their privacy and leaves health information systems open to intrusion. We have examined the real-world challenges of healthcare data collection and integration for a national health data warehouse in this article. To accommodate the limited health data of poor nations like Bangladesh, we have developed privacy-preserving secured record linkage architecture we call Secured Health Data Handler (SHDH). For the purpose of facilitating the knowledge discovery process, our approach may anonymize identifying private data of patients while preserving record linkage in integrated health repositories. Even without a standard ID, our suggested strategy was able to connect records with sufficient accuracy for noisy data, according to the experimental results.","","979-8-3503-7410-0","10.1109/ICBDML60909.2024.10577373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10577373","Secured Data;Data Privacy;Healthcare;Data Linkage;Cyber Security;Secured Health Data Handler;SHDH;Cipher Data Security;CDS","Couplings;Data privacy;Sociology;Data warehouses;Knowledge discovery;Security;Electronic medical records","","","","12","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these challenges, this study introduces a Decentralized Medical Record (DMR) model. The proposed model utilizes the decentralized nature of blockchain and integrates composable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to enable granular data access control. While the integration of blockchain has been studied, the integration of composable NFT in medical records is yet to be explored. The modular design of composable NFT leaves the potential to prevent unnecessary data exposure, ensuring medical data is secure and interoperable throughout treatment collaboration among diverse stakeholders while preserving patient privacy. By incorporating insurance participation in the healthcare ecosystem, this model enables personalized risk assessment. Through Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), the model evaluation focuses on six key aspects: functionality, benefit, potential, accessibility, credibility, and continuity. Using Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) under this methodology, we analyze stakeholder inputs and achieve an overall score of 0,868 indicating a positive rating in addressing stakeholder needs. Our findings contribute to medical data management by demonstrating a novel application of composable NFTs within a structured DMR framework, detailing its mechanism, NFT hierarchy, database architecture, and workflow.","","979-8-3315-1901-8","10.1109/ICEENG64546.2025.11031352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11031352","Blockchain;Composable NFT;Decentralized;Electronic Health Record;Granular Data Access","Access control;Data privacy;Collaboration;Medical services;Data models;Stakeholders;Nonfungible tokens;Electronic medical records;Interoperability;Weighted sum model","","","","31","IEEE","17 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It expands the operational boundaries of Healthcare 4.0 and leverages patient-centric digital wellness. Healthcare 5.0 focuses on real-time patient monitoring, ambient control and wellness, and privacy compliance through assisted technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), Internet-of-Things (IoT), big data, and assisted networking channels. However, healthcare operational procedures, verifiability of prediction models, resilience, and lack of ethical and regulatory frameworks are potential hindrances to the realization of Healthcare 5.0. Recently, explainable AI (EXAI) has been a disruptive trend in AI that focuses on the explainability of traditional AI models by leveraging the decision-making of the models and prediction outputs. The explainability factor opens new opportunities to the black-box models and brings confidence in healthcare stakeholders to interpret the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. EXAI is focused on improving clinical health practices and brings transparency to the predictive analysis, which is crucial in the healthcare domain. Recent surveys on EXAI in healthcare have not significantly focused on the data analysis and interpretation of models, which lowers its practical deployment opportunities. Owing to the gap, the proposed survey explicitly details the requirements of EXAI in Healthcare 5.0, the operational and data collection process. Based on the review method and presented research questions, systematically, the article unfolds a proposed architecture that presents an EXAI ensemble on the computerized tomography (CT) image classification and segmentation process. A solution taxonomy of EXAI in Healthcare 5.0 is proposed, and operational challenges are presented. A supported case study on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is presented that preserves the privacy of local models via federated learning (FL) and EXAI for metric validation.

Unfortunately, existing blockchain-based HIE studies do not consider the privacy issues caused by analyzing senders and receivers of transactions in the blockchain. In this work, we suggest MEXchange, a novel blockchain-based privacy-preserving HIE that prevents the privacy issue by obscuring the sender and concealing receiver addresses. We propose smart contracts and workflow that use ring signature and stealth address for blockchain-based HIE. Software components and implementation of MEXchange on the Ethereum private network are discussed. We evaluate MEXchange quantitatively by measuring the transaction latency and throughput of exchanging. Also, we evaluate MEXchange qualitatively using the requirements of the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). Moreover, we proceed with threat modeling based on STRIDE.

It is vital to enhance the security of healthcare systems to avoid data loss despite the various security policies imposed by healthcare management. The issue needs to be resolved with a comprehensive secure framework, which allows users to access data according to their level of confidentiality. This article presents a solution by imposing multi-level security in e-health systems by integrating the Lattice-Based Access Control (LBAC) model and blockchain-based smart contract mechanisms. These mechanisms provide security levels in compliance with data access restrictions among users and resources while maintaining compliance security levels. By using LBAC, you can provide multilevel protection for access control restrictions, whereas smart contracts are used to ensure the transaction process in a decentralized system via an agreement between the parties. A smart contract validates every user and performs the authentication process in the envisioned model, which uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In the blockchain network, the patient’s e-health details are accessed and stored as immutable blocks. Comparing the proposed scheme with existing benchmarking methods reveals that the proposed scheme preserves privacy, maintains transparency, provides an authentication process, maintains data integrity, and provides multilevel access control security. The proposed model performs better than other existing models. As a result, lattice-based access control enhances the security of e-health records.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3324740","School of Computer Science Engineering and Information Systems, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10285844","Blockchain;e-health records;multi-level security;lattice-based access control;smart contracts","Blockchains;Security;Medical services;Access control;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Smart contracts;Electronic medical records","","24","","59","CCBYNCND","16 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a consequence of this digitization, data became available at any time and in any place. However, despite this ease of data accessibility, persons’ privacy concerns and threats to data privacy have emerged. Thus, serious privacy problems arise while collecting, storing, accessing, sharing, and archiving personal data. Consent management aims to prevent these problems by preserving privacy and protecting personal data. Hence, there are international treaties and legal regulations for personal data protection which state that consent is required to collect, store, manage and share personal data. In this study, a Semantic Web-based personal consent management model is proposed to protect personal data privacy. The proposed model is domain-independent and aims to control and manage the consent of a person. In order to provide the privacy protection of personal data, the proposed model allows individuals to establish their privacy preferences by determining who can access their personal information, for what purposes, and under what circumstances. For this purpose, a group of ontology is created to ensure the informed consent process. The proposed consent management model is generic. As similar to general personal information, personal health information is also sensitive and must be protected from data leakage. Therefore, the proposed generic model is implemented with Semantic Web technologies and demonstrated for the healthcare domain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9881506","Consent;data protection;knowledge-based systems;knowledge representation;ontology;privacy;Semantic Web","Ontologies;Regulation;Law;Data models;Privacy;Medical services;Data protection;Knowledge representation;Semantic Web","","4","","70","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As far as Morocco is concerned, these medical records are still created and captured using manual processes and/or traditional electronic systems. These systems are not standardized and can differ among physicians in private centers and even among healthcare institutions. With the advancement of technology, it has become clear that the current trend regarding healthcare is towards common (remotely controlled and) regularly updated digital medical profiles.

However, there is limited work that focuses on explaining techniques that are best suited for clinicians in their decision making. In this article, we present a new image explainability method named ensemble AI explainability (XAI), which is based on the SHAP and Grad-CAM++ methods. It provides a visual explanation for a deep learning prognostic model that predicts the mortality risk of community-acquired pneumonia and COVID-19 respiratory infected patients. In addition, we surveyed the existing literature and compiled prevailing quantitative and qualitative metrics to systematically review the efficacy of ensemble XAI, and to make comparisons with several state-of-the-art explainability methods (LIME, SHAP, saliency map, Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++). Our quantitative experimental results have shown that ensemble XAI has a comparable absence impact (decision impact: 0.72, confident impact: 0.24). Our qualitative experiment, in which a panel of three radiologists were involved to evaluate the degree of concordance and trust in the algorithms, has showed that ensemble XAI has localization effectiveness (mean set accordance precision: 0.52, mean set accordance recall: 0.57, mean set ${{\bm{F}}_1}$: 0.50, mean set IOU: 0.36) and is the most trusted method by the panel of radiologists (mean vote: 70.2%). Finally, the deep learning interpretation dashboard used for the radiologist panel voting will be made available to the community.

Due to the possibility of data leakage or manipulation during operation, sharing medical records among participants is extremely difficult. Electronic medical record solutions built on blockchain technology hold the solution to addressing these issues.</p> <p>Medical data are sensitive, large‐volume, and need a high level of security. These files, which are known as electronic health records (EHRs), are digital health records that are electronically maintained. EHRs are commonly shared among healthcare stakeholders and are vulnerable to security flaws, privacy violations, and abuse of data. The emerging field of blockchain technology allows nodes in a network or networks to communicate with one another in a distributed and decentralized manner without the need for a central authority.

In recent years, the main networking concerns that have drawn a lot of attention have been Software Defined Networking (SDN), Machine Learning (ML), and onion routing (OR). The impact of Internet of things (IoT) has transformed all fields of life, but it has significantly affected the healthcare industry. In IoMT, the data is transmitted via energy-constrained, low-power IoT sensors with security and privacy issues. This paper addressed the various security issues and employed onion routing to overcome those issues. Software-defined network (SDN) controller and ML techniques are adopted to classify the request received from various applications/industries to voluntarily add their routers in the onion routing network, strengthening the anonymity in the onion routing network. This paper discusses the onion routing process to securely send the patient's health data from the source node to the target node. We designed an AI-enabled onion routing to retain the anonymity of the data. Moreover, a centralized SDN controller categorizes the malicious and non-malicious routers involved in IoMT data transmission. The simulation results demonstrate that the suggested AI module based on the SDN framework outperforms the traditional security mechanism.

This crisis has highlighted two important aspects: 1) the healthcare systems are not designed to deal with such a major health challenge and 2) the older people represent the social categories most exposed to this virus. In this pandemic context, the current need for additional resources in the field of healthcare overlapped a pre-existing challenge of healthcare systems, manifested as a permanent increase in the incidence of chronic diseases related to lifestyle changes and ageing population. This situation proved both the current vulnerabilities and the need for new capabilities. In this respect, the required services are based on smart technology, available nearby or at home, which can provide a continuous self and autonomous care. Consequently, the challenge is to develop these technologies, integrating them in a reliable care product, in order to facilitate the shifting from overloaded hospitals to outpatient settings. Therefore, the pandemic impact can be mitigated by a new model of user centred medical ecosystem focused on the need for protection, prevention and assisting home care of the older people by integrating new digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data, cloud computing or blockchain). For this purpose, a simplified approach of a proposed future ecosystem of digital services is described below, representing a potential elderly-centred digital solution that can lead in any other future pandemic context to better preventive measures for the community, earlier diagnosis and faster treatment resolution for the patient.","2379-0482","978-1-6654-3939-8","10.1109/CSCS52396.2021.00088","EU; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481056","older adults;adaptive technologies;patient-centred ecosystem;personalised assistive care;Quality of Life","Pandemics;Ecosystems;Sociology;Senior citizens;Organizations;Lead;Coronaviruses","","3","","53","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is true especially in e-health data management since patient’s health data must be managed following a slew of established standards. The Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) primarily provide computing and storage resources. However, data security in the cloud is still a major concern. In several instances, Blockchain technology rescues the CSPs by providing the robust security to the underlying data by encrypting data using the unique and secret keys. Each network user in Blockchain has its own unique and secret keys linked directly to the transaction keys as a digital signature to protect the data. However, Blockchain technology suffers from the latency and throughput issues in high workload scenarios. To overcome e-healthcare records privacy issues in a third-party cloud, we designed a Patient’s E-Healthcare Records Management System (PRMS) that focuses on latency and throughput. A comprehensive performance analysis of PRMS is carried out on different third-party clouds to validate its applicability. Moreover, the proposed PRMS system is compared with Blockchain platforms such as Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 and Etherium 1.5.8 against latency and throughput by adjusting the workload for each platform up to 10,000 transactions per second. The proposed PRMS is compared to the Secure and Robust Healthcare-Based Blockchain (SRHB) approach using Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) and small bank datasets. The experimental results indicate that deploying PRMS on Amazon Web Services decreases System Execution Time (SET) and the Average Delay (AD) time by 2.4%, 8.33%, and 25.15%, 15.26%, respectively. Additionally, deploying PRMS on the Google Cloud Platform decreases System Execution Time (SET) and Average Delay (AD) by 2.27%, 2.4%, and 2.72%, 4.73% AD, respectively. The experimental results confirm the superiority of the PRMS under the high workload scenario over SRHB and its applicability in cloud data centers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3198094","Symbiosis International University, Pune, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854886","Cloud computing;e-health;privacy;information security;blockchain","Cloud computing;Medical services;Blockchains;Security;Throughput;Electronic medical records;Data privacy;Electronic healthcare;Storage management","","45","","48","CCBY","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ganasegeran",NA,Artificial Intelligence for Data-Driven Medical Diagnosis,"","2021","","","191","206","Conventional disease detection and control strategies often face substantial challenges with the escalating burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide. Most communities either have higher risks of contracting them, unaware of being afflicted with such conditions or unable to control its progression once detected. This phenomenon escalates significant morbidities, mortalities, economic and social burden to the country. The fusion of Internet of things within healthcare, collectively known as Internet of health things (IoHTs), has accelerated the rise of “intelligent healthcare” among public health systems worldwide. The framework has enabled the environment’s heterogeneity to be interconnected within health facilities and communities through smart health devices and computer programs, thus alleviating any possible chances of having missed diagnosis or ineffective monitoring of patients in physically remote areas, ensuring a model toward effective continuity of care.

As a result, adoption of Blockchain Based Application for plethora of domains continue to grow. Interoperability is the capability of electronic health records (EHRs) and other healthcare information management systems to communicate with each other and to exchange information seamlessly. An effective health information exchange (HIE) delivers data about the patient | regardless of where care or services have been delivered | to the clinician and the care team quickly and securely. Creating a single source of truth is integral to semantic and structural interoperability. Instead of having sections of patient records scattered across several facilities and systems, all available patient information is gathered in a central hub so that care teams can easily access and view all of the same information. By making this information centralized and accessible, providers can budget their available time accordingly. Instead of spending hours mining information from disjointed, complicated, and varying technologies and locations, they can focus on more meaningful patient care interactions, conversations, and treatment plans. Despite the interest in using blockchain for healthcare interoperability, however, little information is available in the concrete architectural styles and patterns for applying blockchain to healthcare apps. With these capabilities we built an web application which performs as an single destination portfolio for every participants of the healthcare sector where the participant like patients can perform activities such as booking an appointment, requesting for medicine and acknowledging feedbacks and also participants like pharmacist and hospital can approve the patient requests accordingly, All this operations was conducted successfully by following traditional approaches like peer-to-peer network.","","978-1-6654-9790-9","10.1109/MysuruCon55714.2022.9972496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9972496","Blockchain;Healthcare;Interoperability","Hospitals;Semantics;Oral communication;Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Information management;Electronic medical records","","","","15","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is stored in the form of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in a central repository. A medical record data is very huge, difficult to read and understand. To give an insight to the professionals in analyzing the different domains a patient belongs to, it is necessary to get pointers to a file before classifying it to a particular department for further analysis. This study provides a EMR processing system to automatically classify EMRs based on the important medical terms using TF-IDF and topic modeling. Automatic Classification of EMRs help the healthcare professionals in taking accurate decisions, providing efficient service, and improves the time taken for processing huge amount of data and in better organizing of patient. The data stored on the cloud may contain duplicate copies of EMR on several storage systems at file level thus increasing the network bandwidth, cost, and consuming storage space. Hence, a deduplication mechanism is required to avoid or reduce the data redundancy. Adapting cloud computing for healthcare systems necessitates sharing patient data with cloud service providers, which creates security concerns as the data may contain diagnosis, medication, laboratory results and medical claims. The main aim of this work is to classify the EMRs as per the specialization using KNN algorithm, optimize storage using deduplication and protect the data using DNA encryption algorithm before uploading to Hadoop. Data redundancy is taken care by implementing deduplication techniques using MD5 hashing. Proposed methodology shows an accuracy of 90% for EMR record classification and handles duplication and security aspects. This in-turn proves the state of the art approach for health care data management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3161439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739732","Classification;clustering;deduplication;DNA encryption;electronic medical records;Hadoop;map reduce","Medical services;Medical diagnostic imaging;Cloud computing;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Electronic medical records;History","","12","","30","CCBY","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This system leverages blockchain technology to address these issues, ensuring data remains immutable, transparent, and highly secure. Utilizing the Ethereum network and IPFS technology, our system provides a decentralized framework for storing and sharing medical records. Healthcare professionals, patients, and authorized parties can seamlessly exchange and access records through Ethereum’s decentralized structure and smart contracts, enabling automated and auditable interactions. To enhance confidentiality, all data uploaded to IPFS undergoes AES 256-bit encryption, with the encrypted Content Identifier (CID) stored on the blockchain. This ensures that intercepted CIDs cannot be accessed without the decryption key. IPFS technology facilitates decentralized storage and retrieval, eliminating the need for a centralized server and improving scalability and resilience. Patients retain full control over their health information, granting or revoking access as necessary. This system ensures secure patient identification, precise access management, and data confidentiality while allowing authorized parties to track and trace record access and modifications. Our blockchain-based EMR management system addresses the inherent risks of traditional centralized systems by providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized solution. By leveraging Ethereum and IPFS, it enhances data security, patient control, and interoperability, thus paving the way for more robust and patient-centric healthcare information management. This approach ensures that healthcare data remains secure, patients maintain control over their information, and authorized parties can effectively manage and access the records.","","979-8-3503-5434-8","10.1109/ICBDS61829.2024.10837244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10837244","Access Control;Blockchain;Cloud Storage;Decentralization;Ethereum;Electronic Medical Records (EMR);Encryption;Identity Management;Interplanetary File System (IPFS);Smart Contracts","Data privacy;Scalability;Smart contracts;Process control;Blockchains;InterPlanetary File System;Servers;Electronic medical records;Interoperability;Resilience","","","","10","IEEE","17 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It assesses patient health and notifies healthcare practitioners of high-risk scenarios through a chatbot. The system was designed to integrate with the famous Thai messaging app LINE, reducing development time and enhancing user-friendliness, and the system allowed patients to upload a pulse oximeter image automatically processed by the PACMAN function to extract oxygen saturation and heart rate values to reduce patient input errors. Methods: This article describes the proposed system and presents a mixed-methods study that evaluated the system’s performance by collecting survey responses from 70 healthcare practitioners and analyzing 14,817 patient records. Results: Approximately 71.4% of healthcare practitioners use the system more than twice daily, with the majority managing 1–10 patients, while 11.4% handle over 101 patients. The progress note is a function that healthcare practitioners most frequently use and are satisfied with. Regarding patient data, 58.9%(8,724/14,817) are male, and 49.7%(7,367/14,817) within the 18 to 34 age range. The average length of isolation was 7.6 days, and patients submitted progress notes twice daily on average. Notably, individuals aged 18 to 34 demonstrated the highest utilization rates for the PACMAN function. Furthermore, most patients, totaling over 95.52%(14,153/14,817), were discharged normally. Conclusion: The findings indicate that CHIVID could be one of the telemedicine solutions for hospitals with patient overflow and healthcare practitioners unfamiliar with telemedicine technology to improve patient care during a critical crisis.

The application of association rule mining in healthcare data has been widespread to this point in time. Most applications focus on positive association rules, ignoring the negative consequences of particular diagnostic techniques. When it comes to bridging divergent diseases and drugs, negative association rules may give more helpful information than positive ones. This is especially true when it comes to physicians and social organizations (e.g., a certain symptom will not arise when certain symptoms exist). Data mining in healthcare must be done in a way that protects the identity of patients, especially when dealing with sensitive information. However, revealing this information puts it at risk of attack. Healthcare data privacy protection has lately been addressed by technologies that disrupt data (data sanitization) and reconstruct aggregate distributions in the interest of doing research in data mining. In this study, metaheuristic-based data sanitization for healthcare data mining is investigated in order to keep patient privacy protected. It is hoped that by using the Tabu-genetic algorithm as an optimization tool, the suggested technique chooses item sets to be sanitized (modified) from transactions that satisfy sensitive negative criteria with the goal of minimizing changes to the original database. Experiments with benchmark healthcare datasets show that the suggested privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of Hiding Failure (HF), Artificial Rule Generation (AR), and Lost Rules (LR).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3192447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832893","Privacy-preserving data mining;healthcare data;evolutionary computation;sanitization process","Medical services;Data privacy;Genetic algorithms;Databases;Optimization;Data integrity;Task analysis","","20","","64","CCBY","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While there are different methods for protecting data using various encryption algorithms, this technology doesn't provide complete security. In some cases, a data distributor may give sensitive data to trusted agents (third parties), and some of the data may be leaked in an unauthorized place. In such cases, the distributor must assess the likelihood that the leaked data came from one or more of the agents, as opposed to having been independently. This paper proposes strategies for allocating data across agents to improve the probability of identifying leaks in the event of data leakage. The proposed methods do not rely on altering the released data like watermarks. Instead, they focus on distributing the data in a way that makes it easier to identify the source of the leak. The paper highlights that data leakage is a significant problem that can lead to a loss of money, damage to reputation, and more. It can occur due to security vulnerabilities, poor data protection practices, or accidentally by a user. Therefore, it's essential to take measures for avoiding data leakage and protect data.

It sparked the development of brand‐new IOT and AI‐based business models and hastened technology adoption. IOT devices and big data not only increased the volume of data but also enhanced the complexity, leading to being more prone to hacking and privacy compromises. More smart and intelligent models need to be introduced to handle these security issues; this is where AI comes in. Conversational AI technologies like chatbots and virtual assistants use big data, machine learning, and natural language processing to simulate human interaction. They understand speech and text inputs and translate them into several languages. Data collecting is necessary for conversational AI to reply to user inquiries. The method is prone to privacy and security breaches. Security measures are required at three levels, i.e., data storage, processing, and transmission. Traditional device centric security systems are not sufficient and need to evolve to data‐centric protection solutions, in which security aspects need to be focused at all the three levels. AI can help to automate the process of dynamic threat detection, reaction, and future avoidance. Many organizations are still resistant to adopt cloud computing due to security concerns, despite all complexities and overheads of managing on‐premises data centers. The paper discusses the available cloud models, related privacy and security issues, and barriers perceived in migrating applications to cloud and finally proposes an advanced security model for cloud‐based conversational AI applications.</p>","","9781394200795","10.1002/9781394200801.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10951793.pdf&bkn=10950236&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Conversational artificial intelligence;Security;Data models;Solid modeling;Servers;Knowledge based systems;Computational modeling;Speech recognition;Biological system modeling","","","","","","8 Apr 2025","","","Wiley","Wiley AI eBook Chapters"

Specifically, healthcare systems are transformed on an unprecedented scale due to the incorporation of cutting-edge technologies, such as loT, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cloud computing. Wearable devices in IoMT use energy-constrained, low-power loT sensors with security and privacy concerns to send data. Various attacks, including device identification, location of the device, and privacy-invading interaction, can significantly impact data transmission between the source and target device. A Software-defined network (SDN) with multiple controllers and AI techniques is used to address numerous security-related issues. This paper proposed a secure data exchange framework, i.e., HEAL-SDN that securely sends the patient's health data from the source SDN controller to the target controller. The ANN model is trained on a network dataset further deployed on SD N controllers to classify the malicious and non-malicious wearable data. The received data are categorized into malicious and non-malicious in various healthcare services of Healthcare 4.0. The simulation results demonstrate that the HEAL-SDN outperforms the traditional security frameworks. HEAL-SDN is quite efficient and achieves good accuracy, i.e., training accuracy (98.72 %), training loss (0.03), for identifying the malicious data in the SDN-enabled healthcare 4.0.","","979-8-3503-7021-8","10.1109/GCWkshps58843.2023.10465150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10465150","Artificial Intelligence;Software Defined Networks;Artificial Neural Network;Deep Learning;Machine Learning;SDN Controllers","Training;Medical services;Artificial neural networks;Data models;Security;Wearable devices;Artificial intelligence","","","","12","IEEE","21 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The structural information contents in big data vary in their representations, and the algorithms have to deal with their sparsity of underlying datasets. Thus, in engineering science applications, the methodologies play a significant role in finding out extremums with constraints. However, due to their paramount size, the traditional algorithms have to deal with contemporarily non‐convex nature of data and have to covenant with manifold parameters. Consequently, the needs for dealing with larger datasets is equally parallel growing and have opened up variety of new techniques as well as delving into innovative research directions.

Given the significant variability among individuals with chronic diseases, tailored approaches are imperative. Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) may help to address the diverse and evolving needs of this demographic. To investigate this approach, we developed an AUI prototype informed by existing literature and used it as the basis for a focus group and interview study involving 22 participants. Concurrently, a quantitative survey was carried out to extract preferences for AUIs in chronic disease related applications with 90 participants. Our findings reveal that user engagement with AUIs is influenced by individual capabilities and disease severity. Additionally, we explore user preferences for AUIs, expanding the adaptation literature by uncovering usage challenges, proposing practical strategies for enhanced AUI design, and acknowledging potential trade-offs between usability and adaptation. Lastly, we present design considerations for AUIs in chronic disease applications, aiming to prevent user overload and maintain critical software functionality and usability aspects.CCS CONCEPTS• Human-centered computing → Graphical user interfaces; User interface programming.LAY ABSTRACTAlmost half of Australians are estimated to have one or more chronic diseases in 2020–21. Mobile health tools show promise in helping people manage chronic diseases, but these are not commonly used among many individuals with chronic conditions. People with chronic diseases have diverse needs, so a one-size-fits-all approach does not work well. Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) offer a solution by tailoring the user experience to individual needs. In our study, we created an AUI prototype based on our investigation of the existing research. We tested our prototype through focus group sessions and interviews. At the same time, we conducted a survey to learn more about their preferences for AUIs in apps related to chronic diseases. Our research revealed that how much users engage with AUIs depends on their individual abilities and the seriousness of their illness. We also discovered what users like and dislike about AUIs, highlighting some challenges in their use. To make AUIs better, we suggested some practical ideas and recognised that there can be a balance between making them easy to use and adaptive. Lastly, we provided some tips for designing AUIs in apps for chronic diseases to ensure they are user-friendly, without making them too complicated, and still offering important features.","2832-7616","979-8-4007-0499-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554790","adaptive user interface;AUI;chronic disease;mHealth applications","Surveys;Human computer interaction;Prototypes;User experience;Software;Usability;Interviews","","2","","99","CCBY","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Natalia",NA; NA; NA,Semantic Technologies for Intelligent Industry 4.0 Applications,"","2023","","","329","358","As the world enters the era of big data, there is a serious need to give a semantic perspective to the data in order to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make intelligent decisions. Semantic technologies offer the richest machine-interpretable (rather than just machine-processable) and explicit semantics that are being extensively used in various domains and industries. These technologies reduce the problem of large semantic loss in the process of modelling knowledge, and provide sharable, reusable knowledge, and a common understanding of the knowledge. As a result, the interoperability and interconnectivity of the model make it priceless for addressing the issues of querying data. These technologies work with the concepts and relations that are very close to the working of the human brain. They provide a semantic representation of any data format: unstructured or semi-structured. As a consequence, data becomes real-world entity rather than a string of characters. For these reasons, semantic technologies are highly valuable tools to simplify the existing problems of the industry leading to new opportunities. However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed to make industrial applications and machines smarter. This book aims to provide a roadmap for semantic technologies and highlights the role of these technologies in industry. The book also explores the present and future prospects of these semantic technologies along with providing answers to various questions like: Are semantic technologies useful for the next era (industry 4.0)? Why are semantic technologies so popular and extensively used in the industry? Can semantic technologies make intelligent industrial applications? Which type of problem requires the immediate attention of researchers? Why are semantic technologies very helpful in people’s future lives? This book will potentially serve as an important guide towards the latest industrial applications of semantic technologies for the upcoming generation, and thus becomes a unique resource for scholars, researchers, professionals and practitioners in the field.","","9788770227810","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10144418.pdf&bkn=10144417&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","5 Jun 2023","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The vital signs of the patient detected by the sensors are private, valuable information that might be exploited in several ways by malicious parties. This means that successful encryption protection methods are essential for the broad use of WBANs. In this present research, a unique hybrid “EAES-SI” framework is proposed as a means of protecting the confidentiality and safety of medical records sent through WBAN. To prevent loss of information and fraudulent attempts, an “Enhanced Advanced Encryption Standard (EAES)” was developed first to encrypt the information while it is sent from the patient's body to the “Sink Node (SiN)/Base Station (BS)”. The EAES is an improvement over the standard AES when it comes to the amount of data and keys. Next, a “Swarm Intelligence (SI)” approach is proposed, depicted upon the cooperative behavior of swarming creatures, to determine the most secure and efficient means of transferring data. After an optimum route has been determined, SI will send the encrypted information from EAES down that way. Thus, the proposed EAES-SI approach reduces both energy consumption and processing time. The suggested EAES-SI, which uses medical information as its backbone, offers an increased level of confidentiality of the information and an improved privacy ratio. Comparing the “Security Ratio”, “Energy Consumption Ratio”, “Encryption Time” and “Decryption Time” of the proposed EAES-SI with the existing BC and ADC frameworks, the proposed EAES-SI framework is shown to be the most secure option.","","979-8-3503-4060-0","10.1109/ICECA58529.2023.10394960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10394960","WSN;Security;EAES;SI;ADC;BC","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Body area networks;Safety;Encryption;Data communication","","1","","16","IEEE","9 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The characteristics of majority RBC cells changes drastically in its nature by becoming gummy, rigid and crescent or C -shaped cells which makes it tough to traverse through very small blood capillaries and restricting the normal flow of blood by blocking or closing the blood vessels. The major function of RBC cell is to carry oxygen to other parts of the body without which a human cannot perform his routine activities. A red blood corpuscle (RBC) becomes Sickle RBC (SRBC), when the quantity of Haemoglobin A (HgbA), usually present in normal RBC cell, becomes less in quantity when compared to another substance called Haemoglobin S (HgbS), which is present abundantly in abnormal RBC cells, makes normal RBC cells to narrow down and sooner gets destroyed. Most of the normal RBC cells changes its structure and making a person anemic as a result of which it shows symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, severe pain throughout the body. Sickle cells are more prevalent among children of Africa, where majority of them born with flawed RBC patterns and even die due to this abnormality. This paper outlines about the various state-of-art deep learning models for early detection of sickle cells among children by classifying defective cells from normal cells and finding faulty image patterns of RBC cells in children by using most advanced neural network technique of Artificial Intelligence called Deep Learning. The digital image of a blood sample after pre-processing is given as an input to deep neural network to automatically identify the large population of sickle cell deficient children belonging to a particular geographic location where majority of children with sickle cell disease can be spotted out easily.

Since mobile phones and tablets lack the flexibility required for laborious elderly care work, smart AR glasses have already been considered. Although lightweight smart AR devices with a transparent display are more convenient and responsive in an elderly care workplace, fetching data from the server through the Internet results in network congestion not to mention the limited display area. To devise portable smart AR devices that operate smoothly, we first present a no-keepalive-Internet and privacy-compliant required smart hands-free elderly care support system that employs smart glasses with facial recognition and text-to-speech synthesis technologies. Our support system utilizes automatic lightweight facial recognition to identify residents, and information about each resident in question can be obtained hands-free link with a local database. Moreover, a resident information can be displayed immediately on just a portion of the AR smart glasses on the spot. Due to the limited size of the display area, it cannot show all the necessary information. We therefore exploit synthesized voice in the system to read out the elderly care-related information in its entirety. By using the support system, caregivers can gain an understanding of each resident condition immediately, instead of having to devote considerable time in advance in obtaining the complete information of all elderly residents, especially of new residents. Our experiments on this support system were conducted at an elderly care home in Tokyo. Our lightweight facial recognition model achieved high accuracy with fewer model parameters than current state-of-the-art methods. The validation rate of our facial recognition system in the practical use scenario was 99.3% or higher with the false accept rate of 0.001, and caregivers rated the acceptability at 3.6 (5 levels) or higher.","","978-1-6654-3734-9","10.1109/ISM52913.2021.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666085","Elderly care support system;smart AR glasses;AI technology","Face recognition;Multimedia systems;Employment;Glass;Mobile handsets;Internet;Speech synthesis","","6","","37","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A core concept within this view is data governance, which aligns strategy in data-relevant structures and entities with data processes, actors, architectures, and overall data management. Data governance is not a new concept and has long been addressed by scientists and practitioners from an enterprise perspective. In the urban context, however, data governance has only recently attracted increased attention, despite the unprecedented relevance of data in the advent of smart cities. Urban data governance can create semantic compatibility between heterogeneous technologies and data silos and connect stakeholders by standardizing data models, processes, and policies. This research provides a foundation for developing a reference model for urban data governance, identifies challenges in dealing with data in cities, and defines factors for the successful implementation of urban data governance. To obtain the best possible insights, the study carries out qualitative research following the design science research paradigm, conducting semi-structured expert interviews with 27 municipalities from Austria, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The subsequent data analysis based on cognitive maps provides valuable insights into urban data governance. The interview transcripts were transferred and synthesized into comprehensive urban data governance maps to analyze entities and complex relationships with respect to the current state, challenges, and success factors of urban data governance. The findings show that each municipal department defines data governance separately, with no uniform approach. Given cultural factors, siloed data architectures have emerged in cities, leading to interoperability and integrability issues. A city-wide data governance entity in a cross-cutting function can be instrumental in breaking down silos in cities and creating a unified view of the city’s data landscape. The further identified concepts and their mutual interaction offer a powerful tool for developing a reference model for urban data governance and for the strategic orientation of cities on their way to data-driven organizations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3302835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10210345","Cognitive mapping;data governance;design science research;urban data governance;smart city;expert interviews","Data governance;Smart cities;Data models;Stakeholders;Interviews;Organizations;Urban areas;Local government","","2","","90","CCBYNCND","7 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal of FC is to position cloud-based services in close proximity to endpoints. The method is meant to meet the minimal latency requirement for Iot - based healthcare equipment. There is a wide range of healthcare data volumes produced by Iot - based healthcare equipment. Network congestion and increased delay are the direct effects of this massive influx of data. Patient information is rendered useless and insufficient for end-users when round-trip time delays rise due to huge data transfer and increasing hop counts between IoTs and cloud servers. In the healthcare industry, real-time data is essential for time-sensitive applications. The medical IoT devices and their users have stringent requirements for latency, and traditional cloud servers just can’t provide them. Therefore, it is important to decrease network delay, compute latency, and communications latency while transmitting data through the Internet of Things. FC allows data to be stored, processed, and analyzed in the cloud and at the network’s edge, where the latency is lower. This article proposes an innovative approach to solving the aforementioned issue. It combines an FC-based analytical model with a hybrid fuzzy-based RL algorithm. High latency in healthcare IoTs, between users and cloud servers, is something that has to be mitigated. Allocation and selection of data packets in an IoT-FC setting are handled with the help of a fuzzy inference system, reinforcement learning, and neural network evolution techniques provided by the suggested smart FC model parameters and algorithms. The method is put through its paces on the iFogSim (Net-Beans) as well as Spyder simulations (Python).

As a distributed learning framework, federated learning can train a shared model from multiple independent edge nodes using local data, which has greatly promoted the development of IoMT. One of the main challenges of EEG-based epilepsy recognition in IoMT is that EEG records show varying distributions in different devices, different times, and different people. This nonstationary characteristic of EEG reduces the accuracy of the recognition model. To improve the classification performance in IoMT, a hierarchical domain adaptation projective dictionary pair learning (HDA-PDPL) model is developed in the study. HDA-PDPL integrates EEG signals from different domains (person, edge nodes, devices, etc.) into a set of hierarchical subspace and simultaneously learns synthesis and analysis dictionary pairs in each layer. Specifically, a nonlinear transform function is introduced to seek hierarchical feature projection. The domain adaptation term on sparse coding builds a connection between different domains. Thus, the shared synthesis and analysis dictionaries can encode domain-invariant representation and discrimination knowledge from different domains. Besides, the local preserved term of projective codes is introduced to capture the potential discriminative local structures of samples. The experimental results on two EEG epilepsy classifications verified that the HDA-PDPL model can outperform other comparisons by utilizing more shared knowledge of different domains.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3176656","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171203,62172192); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK 20211333); Science and Technology Project of Changzhou City(grant numbers:CE20215032); Jiangsu Future Network Scientific Research Fund Project(grant numbers:FNSRFP-2021-YB-36); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JUSRP122035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9784917","Domain adaptation;electroencephalogram~(EEG) signals;epilepsy classification;Internet of medical things (IoMT);projective dictionary pair","Electroencephalography;Dictionaries;Brain modeling;Adaptation models;Machine learning;Collaborative work;Encoding","","51","","30","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing methods often struggle with insufficient semantic understanding and managing diverse software requirements. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework named EnsCL-CatBoost (Ensembled Contrastive Learning with CatBoost) to address these challenges by enhancing classification accuracy and robustness. Our method uses a weighted ensemble of Doc2Vec, Word2Vec, and FastText, leveraging their strengths for richer semantic representation. Unlike conventional strategies, we incorporate contrastive learning with the InfoNCE loss function, boosting discriminative power by clustering similar samples and distancing dissimilar ones, thus enhancing robustness and model generalization. To tackle class imbalance, we integrate SMOTE-Tomek links into the embedding process, achieving balanced class distribution before classification. Additionally, our evaluation extends beyond test datasets to new, unlabeled datasets, demonstrating practical applicability in real-world scenarios. We compare our framework’s performance with five machine learning classifiers which we trained using traditional embedding techniques. The results show that our method significantly outperforms others, achieving 94% accuracy. Our research transparently presents tool-based results, highlighting the transformative potential of automation in software requirement classification and setting a new benchmark for practical deployment in diverse environments, paving the way for future research in the field.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3452011","Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2008085MF189); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10658972","Software requirements classification;SMOTE-Tomek;EnsCL-CatBoost;weighted ensemble;machine learning classifiers;contrastive learning","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Support vector machines;Contrastive learning;Software algorithms;Software performance;Machine learning;Contrastive learning","","1","","34","CCBYNCND","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Diabetes mellitus is one such disease which is predominant among a global population which ultimately leads to blindness and death in some cases. The model proposed in this system attempts to design and deliver an intelligent solution for predicting diabetes in the early stages and address the problem of late detection and diagnosis. Intensive research is carried out in many tropical countries for automating this process through a machine learning model. The accuracy of machine learning algorithms is more than satisfactory in the detection of Type 2 diabetes from the dataset of PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. An additional feature of hereditary factor is implemented to the existing multiple objective fuzzy classifiers.

The ease of time-independent interaction from geographically remote areas is a core advantage of the IoHT system, which offers preventive or proactive healthcare facilities at a lower cost. IoHT communication, on the other hand, is usually carried out with a range of low-power biomedical sensors, rendering them vulnerable to cyber-attacks and incompatible with traditional cryptographic techniques. The most critical security concern in IoHT is ensuring the authenticity of patients’ health-related messages sent over the internet. Other key concerns include receiver anonymity and forward security, which means that only the sender knows the identities of the recipients. As a result, even if the private key of senders compromised, the adversary will be unable to decrypt the ciphertext. Existing signcryption schemes that employ certificateless cryptography for the healthcare system failed to guarantee both receiver anonymity and forward security simultaneously. Therefore, in this article, we propose an anonymous certificateless signcryption scheme for IoHT applications, which is based on the notion of the Hyperelliptic Curve (HEC) cryptosystem to satisfy these security requirements. The proposed scheme guarantees formal security analysis for confidentiality, unforgeability, and receiver anonymity using the Random Oracle Model (ROM). The results authenticate that the proposed scheme improves security while lowering computation and communication costs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097403","Deanship of Scientific Research, Qassim University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490200","Internet of things;IoHT;security;signcryption;hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem;random oracle model","Security;Cryptography;Receivers;Wireless communication;Elliptic curves;Internet;Elliptic curve cryptography","","21","","32","CCBY","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Machine learning classifiers have been used to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases by analyzing a variety of clinical, demographic, and lifestyle data. By training on large, diverse datasets, these classifiers can identify patterns and relationships between different variables and accurately predict CVD risk in individuals. In the proposed study we have utilized the kaggle and IEEE data port datasets for estimating the chances of heart disease. A model was developed using seven machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, CART, KNN, Naive Bayes, Support vector machine (SVM), and Ada Boost. A variety of evaluation metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of the model. We have included accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, as well as ROC, F1 score, Mathew correlation and log loss.

Therefore, a critical understanding of palliative care processes is necessary for improving respective cancer care systems. In this research palliative care Business Process Models (BPMs) have been developed to empower palliative care domain experts not only attaining a critical understanding of the currently running palliative care operations, but also in informing further required improvements with associated implications on cancer patients. Amongst the key outcomes of developing and analysing palliative BPMs in a cancer care organisation revealed identifying gaps, limitations, challenges, and opportunities to reflectively improve palliative care processes in cancer care centres.

The logs of security events correlated from multiple channels in a live mode, either from the SIEM agents, IDS, IPS, antivirus, or any security feeders to a single monitor dashboard, show the incidents on each device separately. The gap in the previous models is that there are no unique measures on the security devices chain. This study seeks to provide the best level of security for the systems and programs operating in the data centers that write data logs about all events for auditing and information security purposes. A novel security procedural model, grounded in the playbook framework, was introduced for implementation within the feeders chain. The Playbook concept ensures that all systems have an orchestration workflow that allows them to play harmonic rules between them.

This paper explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making for this condition. We assess interpretability and reliability by analyzing the decision-making process of Machine Learning (ML) models tailored to identify Meningococcal meningitis among different etiologies of meningitis. Initially, we train and test various ML models, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision tree, gradient boosting, AdaBoost, random forest, and LightGBM classifier, on a dataset comprising 460 cases of Meningococcal meningitis and 474 cases of other types of meningitis. Among these models, the gradient-boosting model exhibits superior performance metrics, including accuracy (0.88), precision (0.92), recall (0.83), AUROC (0.93), and f1-score (0.87). Subsequently, we employ Explainable AI (XAI) tools (ELI5 and LIME) to elucidate the importance of features in the ML models. Our results highlight key factors contributing to model success, such as Neisseria meningitidis identified through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and latex agglutination, gram-negative diplococci in CSF smear examination, white cell counts in CSF, and patient age. Local explanations reveal the presence of neutrophils in CSF as a characteristic feature of Meningococcal meningitis. LIME analysis indicates the significance of low lymphocyte percentages and elevated white blood cell counts in predicting this condition. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating global and local interpretability techniques, aligning with expert knowledge, and emphasizing the importance of transparent AI models in clinical decision-making processes.","2767-9802","979-8-3503-5098-2","10.1109/IS61756.2024.10705255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10705255","Meningococcal meningitis;Machine learning;Gradient Boosting;Interpretability;ELI5;LIME","Measurement;Support vector machines;Logistic regression;Accuracy;Microorganisms;Explainable AI;Decision making;Nearest neighbor methods;Reliability;Random forests","","","","22","IEEE","9 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
