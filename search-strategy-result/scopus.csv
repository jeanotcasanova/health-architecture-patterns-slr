This system, along with its clinical graphical user interface the Computerized Patient Record System, form a key link in VA health care. A Veteran who receives healthcare through the VA can have their EHR accessed by clinicians at any VA healthcare facility across the United States and its territories. Data aggregated daily at a corporate data warehouse supports VA quality improvement and research. Organizing Construct: Serving over 9 million Veterans, the VA is one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the United States. It has been a leader in the development and use of healthcare informatics, EHR, and big data analytics for over 30 years. Nurses engaged in major roles in the evolution of these developments. Conclusions: With over 500 nurses as members, the Office of Nursing Informatics’ Field Alliance demonstrates the VA’s continuing commitment to fostering nursing informatics. The commitment includes investment by the VA to develop nursing informaticists from among its own staff. Clinical Relevance: Exemplars of the impact of nursing informatics are shared. Future directions include an EHR that begins during military service and follows the Veteran into VA health care. © 2021 Sigma Theta Tau International","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102285790"

However, data tends to be fragmented among health information systems, preventing interoperability of medical data at the point of care. In order to address this gap, we propose and implement a novel architecture that utilizes blockchain and IoT technologies for integrating personal health data. The architecture comprises of two components: (1) BlockIoT contains a suite of smart contracts that define data collection and integration functionalities, and (2) RETEL utilizes a novel smart contract deployment and execution architecture. The BlockIoT-RETEL architecture combines these two components to provide a scalable mechanism for bootstrapping a personal health data collection infrastructure in the context of healthcare. We have compared the key functionalities of our system with existing comparable state-of-the-art systems in healthcare and evaluated the performance in prototypical healthcare settings with simulated data that shows promising results. © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125649120"

The key limitation in adopting electronic health (e-Health) services in developing countries is the health data interoperability problem. Most developing countries are being confronted with the utilization of e-Health systems for their health care services. This study aims to develop a prospective e-Health system for developing countries to improve the effectiveness of health care services. This paper presents an enhanced e-Health framework using distributed memory and heterogeneous data handling mechanisms with loose coupling. The distributed e-Health has been designed using e-Health standards that are compatible with health level 7 (HL7) and can facilitate interoperability among health information systems. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) has been implemented to store regular backups of heterogeneous health data. The HL7 standards can also handle security threats. Data interchange from one e-Health system server to another has been conducted based on the experimental results. The distributed database has been made accessible from a remote server by using loosely coupled technology. It also provided the e-Health data recovery features and handled an extensive database through a distributed environment. According to the study, the developed system can deliver a low-cost service to the intended developing-country community effectively. © 2021 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151700216"

One of the manifestations of this scientific problem is the need to consider critical non-medical factors, including socio-economic, natural, and ecological conditions. This understanding arises due to the development of technologies for the treatment and diagnosis of socially significant diseases in the development of treatment and rehabilitation programs. An important obstacle to solving this scientific problem is that the necessary requirement of natural science research—reproducibility of experimental results—cannot be fully met due to the uniqueness of these systems. The second key obstacle is associated with the complexity of the current socio-economic systems, which does not allow for their full formal description. This is evidenced by the result of a review of current approaches. The solution is proposed by integrating interdisciplinary approaches based on the patterns of fuzzy-multiple and cenological modeling, which have shown their effectiveness in various fields of knowledge.

This study addresses these issues by evaluating the implementation of a semi-real-time transcription system using a distributed architecture with a message broker to enhance the documentation of clinical examination processes in primary health services. The research focuses on assessing the feasibility of this approach by measuring key performance indicators such as latency and word error rate (WER) during clinical conversation transcription. Audio recordings were segmented into shorter fragments to simulate real-time transcription, and data transmission was conducted through the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The findings demonstrate that the average latencys achieved by semi-real-time transcription system is 7.7s, indicating its potential suitability for clinical documentation applications that do not require strict real-time processing. However, glitches observed in the message broker's forwarding mechanism suggest the need for further optimization to ensure consistent performance. Future work aims to develop strategies to minimize transcription errors, enhance reliability, and improve the overall integration of this system in healthcare settings.

Such autonomous standalone systems do not communicate through a network thereby making it a challenge to share healthcare data. Therefore, to re-engineer health information systems (HISs) to develop interoperable adaptive enterprise architecture (EA) systems for healthcare, the study aimed to discover and capture healthcare interoperability functional imperatives through understanding the expectations of healthcare practitioners and patients on post-development of an interoperable HIS. Therefore, the study's aim was to determine the HISs interoperability perceived functional expectations by both patients and practitioners in fulfilling their healthcare receipt and provision needs in an integrated healthcare environment, respectively. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) was used as the main study framework to guide the classification of the expectations from the HIS by patients and practitioners deriving the needs from the four domains which are, business architecture (BA), application architecture (AA), data architecture (DA), and technical architecture. The study used interviews and questionnaire surveys to collect qualitative and quantitative data respectively. The study used purposive sampling to select interview participants. A total of 19 interviews were conducted with healthcare practitioners. Questionnaires were collected from 71 healthcare practitioners and 143 patients and analyzed quantitatively respectively to understand the most significant needs anticipated in an interoperable HIS. The research targeted age groups of at least 20 years and above. The study discovered that patients and practitioners expect the interoperable healthcare environment to support the acquisition of disease knowledge through healthcare surveillance synergies; create healthcare awareness through coordinated digital interactions; augmentation of healthcare intelligence for patient-care through the healthcare knowledgebase; allow treatment collaboration by various healthcare practitioners in the healthcare ecosystem and mostly achieving a guaranteed healthcare system security and assurance environment. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164742128"

Early detection of complications can help avoid many of the reported cases. Due to long distances to nearby health facilities, lack of knowledge, and poverty, the majority of expectant mothers in rural developing nations are still adamant about prioritizing their health during this very sensitive period. This study aimed at designing and prototyping a system intended to help improve maternal health in rural areas of developing nations. This can be achieved by providing a relatively easy way to monitor the health of expectant mothers remotely and provide vital information in the form of periodic tips with automatic alerts and tracking in case of missed clinical appointments. Therefore, an architecture for context awareness and an IoT-based system is proposed to improve pregnancy monitoring in Africa and thus reduce fatalities and complications. The system uses a pulse sensor, temperature sensor, and GPS module to collect data with an Arduino as the microcontroller. The collected data is sent to the cloud using the GSM module. The cloud data is stored, processed, analysed, and then sent to the health worker. In case of any health complication or an appointment is missed, the health officials are alerted in real-Time. This system will ensure a timely response in an emergency, thus leading to better health and contributing to sustainable development goals.  © 2022 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129949744"

Blockchain technology, including NFTs, provides equitable access to wealth, increases transparency, eliminates personal or institutional biases of intermediaries, reduces inefficiencies, and ensures accountability. Blockchain architecture is ideal for ensuring security and privacy while granting individuals jurisdiction over their own information, making it a unique solution to the current limitations of existing health information systems. NFTs can be used to give patients the option to monetize their health data and provide valuable data to researchers. Wearable technology companies can also give their customers the option to monetize their data while providing data necessary to improve their products. Additionally, the process of receiving a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and the distribution of solid organs for transplantation could benefit from the integration of NFTs into the allocation process. However, there are limitations to the technology, including high energy consumption and the need for regulatory guidance. Further research is necessary to fully understand the potential of NFTs in healthcare and how it can be integrated with existing health information technology. Overall, NFTs have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare sector, providing benefits such as improved access to health information and increased efficiency in the distribution of organs for transplantation.

The military continues to have higher rates of psychiatric illness compared to the civilian population. Having a diagnosis such as posttraumatic stress disorder or depression may create challenges in using health care services, such as surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate eye surgery cancellation, risk factors for cancellation, and areas for intervention within the VA. Materials and Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. The Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture were queried to identify all surgical requests at the West Los Angeles VA in 2019. Data collection included sociodemographic information and comorbid medical conditions, including psychiatric illness. Exploratory analyses using univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate factors associated with surgery cancellation. Results: A total of 1,115 surgical requests were identified with a cancellation rate of 23.7% (n = 270). Sociodemographic factors were similar between those with completed and cancelled surgery. However, having a psychiatric diagnosis correlated with surgery cancellation. For all subspecialties, patients with schizophrenia were more likely to have cancellation (odds ratio [OR], 2.53, P =. 04). For retina surgery, patients with posttraumatic stress disorder were more likely to have cancellation (OR, 4.23, P =. 01). Glaucoma patients with anxiety (OR, 5.78, P =. 05) and depression (OR, 4.05, P =. 04) were more likely to have cancellation. Conclusions: There was a significant amount of eye surgery cancellations in veterans with variation by subspecialty and comorbid conditions. Having a psychiatric illness was correlated with increased rates of surgery cancellation amongst veterans. Areas to improve surgical utilization include risk stratification and increased support of vulnerable patients before surgery.  © 2024 The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

Ergo, to treat, store and publish such data is an emergent task. Furthermore, analysing data in real-time using streaming and processing technologies and methods, in order to obtain quality data, prepared to support decision making is of extreme value.

Countless studies have been proposed in the healthcare domain in search of solutions that allow the flow of data in real-time. However, the work presented hereby is distinguished by allowing the collection, processing, storage and analysis of Intensive Care Units (ICU) data, both collected in real-time from bedside monitors but also stored in a historical repository. The architecture proposed makes use of current technologies, like Nextgen Connector as message supplier and integrator, Elasticsearch as a search index, Kibana for viewing stored data and Grafana for real-time streaming.

To get around the barriers that prevent an efficient process of exchanging medical data. The integrated computerized clinical information system is part of the Hospital Information System (HIS), which aims to improve hospital operations and clinical management. Furthermore, the patient has access to an accurate electronic medical record that has been stored. For research and statistical applications, such records can be utilized in a data warehouse. The architecture of a centralized information system, on which HIS was established intended for the rapid transmission of both operational and administrative information. It would be difficult and It requires a lot of money and resources to set up an independent information management system for a small village hospital. The hospital information system in use presently, information is only shared within the same hospital. The theory of cloud computing serves as the proposal's basis. The 'cloud' makes it possible for greater analysis, sharing, and exchange of medical data from images. Doctors may be able to get the data they need due to cloud-based medical image storage, patient will be able to get treatment across hospital departments automating the management of hospital information and computational resources.

Although several models have been proposed such as blockchain, biometrics, and firewalls, insider threats continue to gain momentum. Hence the adoption of the Zero Trust Model seeks to pacify these loopholes. Methods: Zero Trust model is founded on an access policy based on context and continuous user and device authentication and verification. To block lateral movement in system architecture, the ZTA proposes deduction engines as a panacea to patient data security. Results: Prior and current studies have suggested a more technical principle and philosophy in managing and securing patient data, the ZTA has been adopted in other domains and has remained an effective countermeasure in closing the data vulnerability gap. Our model is designed with a full-scale ZTA framework and as such combats the information security gaps. Conclusion: A new architecture for data security is proposed, and insight was drawn from the ZTA principle, with a combination of several technology tools, The adoption of this framework will help to mitigate the current lapses and provide a gateway to ZTA adoption. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180698808"

Such systems are still uncommon in most low and middle income countries. This article describes a first-phase activity in Tanzania to integrate the country’s vertical health management information system with the help of an interoperability layer that enables cross-program data exchange. Methods: From 2014 to 2019, the Tanzanian government and partners implemented a five-step procedure based on the “Mind the GAPS” (governance, architecture, program management, and standards) framework and using both proprietary and open-source tools. In collaboration with multiple stakeholders, the team developed the system to address major data challenges via four fully documented “use case scenarios” addressing data exchange among hospitals, between services and the supply chain, across digital data systems, and within the supply chain reporting system. This work included developing the architecture for health system data exchange, putting a middleware interoperability layer in place to facilitate the exchange, and training to support use of the system and the data it generates. Results: Tanzania successfully completed the five-step procedure for all four use cases. Data exchange is currently enabled among 15 separate information systems, and has resulted in improved data availability and significant time savings. The government has adopted the health information exchange within the national strategy for health care information, and the system is being operated and managed by Tanzanian officials. Conclusion: Developing an integrated HIS requires a significant time investment; but ultimately benefit both programs and patients.

Value-based healthcare reimbursement systems are emerging as an attempt to incentivize patient-centricity and cost containment. From a technological perspective, the transition to digitalized services is intended to support these transformations. A Health Information System (HIS) is a technological solution designed to govern the data flow generated and consumed by healthcare professionals and administrative staff during the delivery of healthcare services. However, the exponential growth of digital capabilities and applied advanced analytics has expanded their traditional functionalities and brought the promise of automating administrative procedures and simple repetitive tasks, while enhancing the efficiency and outcomes of healthcare services by incorporating decision support tools for clinical management. The future of HIS is headed towards modular architectures that can facilitate implementation and adaptation to different environments and systems, as well as the integration of various tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI) models, in a seamless way. As an example, we present the experience and future developments of the European Clinical Database (EuCliD®).

The performance of the most popular two document-based NoSQL back-ends, Couchbase Server and MongoDB, is compared according to the size of the database and query execution time. Results showed that while MongoDB can execute simple single-document queries nearly in milliseconds. It does not provide satisfactory response time for unplanned complex queries spanning multiple documents. By utilizing its analytics services and multi-dimensional scaling architecture, Couchbase Server multi-node cluster outperforms the response times of MongoDB for both simple and complex healthcare data access patterns. The primary advantage of the proposed tightly coupled EHRs processing framework is its flexibility to manage workload according to changing requirements. © 2021","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119662158"

However, achieving this collaboration comes with numerous challenges, including differing approaches, data formats, and standards, as well as concerns about privacy, security, technical complexity, and legal and regulatory issues. To tackle these challenges, we determined a set of interoperability solutions. We also developed a comprehensive, component-based, data-driven framework for healthcare systems. Our study's approach involved three main steps: first, conducting a literature review to gather interoperability requirements and solutions from online databases and grey literature; second, carrying out a qualitative study to develop a framework based on the review results and focus group discussions; and third, using the Delphi method to validate the framework with experts. We extracted information from 36 articles during the screening and assessment process. Based on the proposed framework, we organized the identified themes into various categories, including architecture, architecture components, standards, platforms, policies, data sources, consumers, applications, level of interoperability, healthcare facilities, and considerations. Experts believe that establishing a comprehensive architecture for launching interoperability between health information systems can greatly facilitate this process. All framework components (totaling 197) received unanimous approval. The landscape of healthcare delivery is shifting from a focus on diseases to a patient-centered, data-driven approach. There is a growing demand for personalized healthcare systems, which necessitates increased interoperability among all healthcare stakeholders, particularly when dealing with diverse types of data. Our framework is designed to facilitate the implementation of various types of interoperability in healthcare systems. © 2024","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199672983"

This ensures efficient, patient-focused healthcare delivery in a mobile world where citizens frequently travel for work and leisure. Beyond healthcare delivery, semantic interoperability is crucial for secondary health data use. This paper introduces a tool and techniques for achieving health data semantic interoperability, using reusable visual transformation components to create and validate transformation rules and maps, making them usable for domain experts with minimal technical skills. Methods: The tool and techniques for health data semantic interoperability have been developed and validated using Design Science, a common methodology for developing software artifacts, including tools and techniques. Results: Our tool and techniques are designed to facilitate the interoperability of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) by enabling the seamless unification of various health data formats in real time, without the need for extensive physical data migrations. These tools simplify complex health data transformations, allowing domain experts to specify and validate intricate data transformation rules and maps. The need for such a solution arises from the ongoing transition of the Estonian National Health Information System (ENHIS) from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) to Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), but it is general enough to be used for other data transformation needs, including the European Health Data Space (EHDS) ecosystem. Conclusion: The proposed tool and techniques simplify health data transformation by allowing domain experts to specify and validate the necessary data transformation rules and maps. Evaluation by ENHIS domain experts demonstrated the usability, effectiveness, and business value of the tool and techniques. 2024 Bossenko, Randmaa, Piho and Ross.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213719525"

Thus, this research aimed to develop of semantic-sharing and collaborative-modeling to meet the information exchange requirements of Iran's notifiable diseases surveillance system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the Iran's Notifiable diseases Minimum Data Set (INMDS) was determined according to a literature review coupled with agreements of experts. Then the INMDS was mapped to international terminologies and classification systems, and the Health Level seven-Clinical Document Architecture (HL7-CDA) standard was leveraged to define the exchangeable and machine-readable data formats. RESULTS: A core dataset consisting of 15 classes and 96 data fields was defined. Data elements and response values were mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) reference terminology. Then HL7-CDA standard for interoperable data exchange were defined. CONCLUSION: The notifiable disease surveillance requires an integrative participation of multidisciplinary team. In this field, data interoperability is more essential due to the heterogeneous nature of health information systems. Developing of INMDS based on HL7-CDA along with SNOMED-CT codes offers an inclusive and interoperable dataset that can help make notifiable diseases data more comparable and reportable across studies and organizations. The proposed data model will be further modifications in the future according probable changes in Iran's notifiable diseases list.  © 2021 Journal of Education and Health Promotion.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116106161"

In addition to overblown budgets and elapsed deadlines (ad nauseam), technical issues exist. These include poor usability, instability, system performance, and data inconsistency issues. The issues relate to Software Engineering, and specifically Software Architecture. The role of Software Architecture underpins these issues. However, the enquiries and analyses of these failed Information Systems projects have focused on the perspective of stakeholders (e.g., government ministers and health practitioners) and project managers. While stakeholders provide input into project requirements and goals, the project failure or success does not emanate from these roles exclusively. For example, system instability is not specifically a stakeholder issue but rather a Software Architecture concern. Aim: To bring to bear and address public sector health Information System failure from the Software Architecture perspective. Method: A literature survey was conducted to ascertain the perceived failure and success factors within the public health domain. Results: We observed that the available literature on health Information Systems appears to lack success factors which have been noted in the Software Engineering and Software Architecture literature. Software Architecture appears to be an understudied area within the public health domain. Contribution: To bring awareness to the public health domain that the Information System's success requires multi-faceted perspectives and actions. Specifically, perspectives and actions involving Software Architects and Software Engineers are required to successfully address the quality attributes of the proposed systems during development.

Many applications and systems have been proposed to improve the healthcare area. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid19 turns more focus on healthcare applications. To manage medical data, healthcare professionals in developed countries have adopted several electronic healthcare information systems and technologies in recent years. However, these technologies show serious privacy risks and security issues, especially in the transfer of data and the recording of data transactions. Furthermore, the high cost of these technologies acquisition, as well as the complexity of their management, make their application in underdeveloped nations extremely problematic. This article proposes a solution based on a decentralized Blockchain architecture to reinforce the security of health information systems. This solution is particularly recommended for developing countries which lack high-tech infrastructures and suffer from poor interoperability between existing information systems. Various researches and works that implement blockchainbased solutions in the security of electronic health information systems (eHIS) are discussed in this article. A new approach based on a hyperledger fabric, implementing smart contracts and several other components is proposed. The suggested architecture involves many actors who can interact with medical records such as patients, doctors, pharmacists, laboratories and insurance companies. Data privacy is guaranteed because there is minimal risk of unauthorized access entities, and by design, the smart contract is the sole way to manipulate participant data. Various optimization and measurement experiments were carried on.

Since the implementation of health information systems, some issues such as interoperability, security, and privacy have been strongly questioned. Storing and consulting them raises the same concerns. Given these concerns, any attempt to introduce healthcare information systems must guarantee the security and privacy, integrity, and immutability of patient information. It is in this sense that blockchain technology and the openEHR open data model appear, as they manage to guarantee interoperability between systems, data security and guarantees about queries of each stored data. In order to understand how to increase security and immutability in an implementation of open data models in hospitals, two distinct architectures were developed. In these architectures, several performance tests were carried out. To understand which of them represents more value to a health institution, an analysis of the results was prepared and, consequently, a discussion about them was held to be able to draw the respective conclusions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

Current and emerging PHSs use either a centralized database, peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, or distributed ledger technology for PHS deployment. The evolving COVID-19 decentralized Bluetooth-based tracing systems are examples of disease-centric P2P PHSs. Although using P2P technology for the provision of PHSs can be flexible, scalable, resilient to a single point of failure, and inexpensive for patients, the use of health information on P2P networks poses major security issues as users must manage information security largely by themselves. Objective: This study aims to identify the inherent security issues for PHS deployment in P2P networks and how they can be overcome. In addition, this study reviews different P2P architectures and proposes a suitable architecture for P2P PHS deployment. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. We searched the following databases: IEEE Digital Library, PubMed, Science Direct, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar. The search was conducted on articles published between 2008 and 2020. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System was used as a guide for rating security issues. Results: Our findings are consolidated into 8 key security issues associated with PHS implementation and deployment on P2P networks and 7 factors promoting them. Moreover, we propose a suitable architecture for P2P PHSs and guidelines for the provision of PHSs while maintaining information security. Conclusions: Despite the clear advantages of P2P PHSs, the absence of centralized controls and inconsistent views of the network on some P2P systems have profound adverse impacts in terms of security. The security issues identified in this study need to be addressed to increase patients' intention to use PHSs on P2P networks by making them safe to use. © Imrana Abdullahi Yari, Tobias Dehling, Felix Kluge, Juergen Geck, Ali Sunyaev, Bjoern Eskofier.

These profiles describe how standards should be used in particular use cases. These profiles are very helpful but their correct use is challenging, if the user is not familiar to the specifications. Therefore, inexperienced modelers of information systems quickly lose track of existing IHE profiles. In addition, the users of these profiles are often not aware of rules that are defined within these profiles and of dependencies that exist between the profiles. There are also modelers that do not notice the differences between the implemented actors, because they do not know the optional capabilities of some actors. The aim of this paper is therefore to describe a concept how modelers of information systems can be supported in the selection and use of IHE profiles and how this concept was prototypically implemented in the ""Three-layer Graph-based meta model"" modeling tool (3LGM Tool). The described modeling process consists of the following steps that can be looped: defining the use case, choosing suitable integration profiles, choosing actors and their options and assigning them to application systems, checking for required actor groupings and modeling transactions. Most of these steps were implemented in the 3LGM Tool. Further implementation effort and evaluation of our approach by inexperienced users is needed. But after that our tool should be a valuable tool for modelers planning healthcare information system architectures, in particular those based on IHE. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107238415"

However, their interoperability remains a global challenge hindering diagnosis, monitoring of health conditions, and data access irrespective of geographic location. Given the widespread use of mobile devices by patients and health care providers, linking mHealth apps and eRecord systems could result in a comprehensive and seamless data exchange within a health care community. The Botswana National eHealth Strategy recognizes interoperability as an issue and mHealth as a potential solution for some health care needs but is silent on how to make mHealth apps interoperable with existing eRecord systems. A literature review and analysis of existing mHealth interoperability frameworks found none suitable for Botswana. As such, it was critical to conceptualize, design, and develop an mHealth-eRecord Interoperability Framework (mHeRIF) to enhance the interoperability pillar of the Botswana National eHealth Strategy and leverage the full benefits of linking mHealth apps with other health information systems. Objective: This study aimed to validate the developed mHeRIF and determine whether it requires further refinement before consideration towards enhancing the National eHealth Strategy. Methods: Published framework validation approaches guided the development of a survey administered to 12 purposively selected local and international eHealth experts. In total, 25% (3/12) of the experts were drawn from Botswana, 25% (3/12) were drawn from low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 25% (3/12) were drawn from low- and middle-income countries outside Africa, and 25% (3/12) were drawn from high-income countries. Quantitative responses were collated in a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp) spreadsheet for descriptive analysis, and the NVivo software (version 11; QSR International) was used to aid the thematic analysis of the qualitative open-ended questions. Results: The analysis of responses showed overall support for the content and format of the proposed mHeRIF. However, some experts’ suggestions led to 4 modest revisions of the mHeRIF. Conclusions: Overall, the experts’ reviews showed that the mHeRIF could contribute to the National eHealth Strategy by guiding the linking of mHealth apps to existing eRecord systems in Botswana.

Recognizing the relevance of these systems, we propose the strengthening of national emergency response information management systems (ERIMS) within the broader digital health information system (HIS) framework. We aim to develop and present an innovative assessment tool designed to evaluate and assist in the strengthening of ERIMS, contributing to a more resilient and effective emergency response. Methods: This study presents the development of an ERIMS assessment tool using a systems-based approach and defined standards by the WHO Regional Office for Europe. The tool provides a systematic methodology to evaluate and enhance a country's ERIMS capacity, and is designed to accommodate different information system architecture, emergency response coordination mechanisms, and digitalisation levels. The development process involved consultations with experts in digital health, emergency management, and public health policy, as well as lessons identified through pilot implementation of the assessment tool in several countries. Main findings: The application of this tool revealed gaps in existing ERIMS and highlighted the importance of digital transformation in emergency management practices. The tool facilitated the identification of priority areas for improvement and supported the establishment of best practices and international standards for digital health initiatives that relate to emergency management. Conclusions: This assessment tool represents a contribution to the field of digital health and emergency management. It offers a way for countries to enhance their emergency response capabilities, focusing on information for action. By improving ERIMS, countries can ensure better preparedness, timely response and effective recovery from health emergencies, thereby strengthening global health security in the face of future challenges. © 2025","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215857421"

An essential area of study is how to keep records linked when merging medical data. Researchers have proposed many solutions to this issue, all of which are relevant to industrialized nations that use patient identification numbers such as social security numbers, health insurance numbers, universal patient identifiers (UPIs), etc., to keep track of electronic health records. Because of issues with missing data, unclear patient identification, and excessive noise in patient information, these systems are not suitable for record linking of health data in underdeveloped nations. There is a serious concern that patients' personally identifiable information stored in electronic health records poses a threat to their privacy and leaves health information systems open to intrusion. We have examined the real-world challenges of healthcare data collection and integration for a national health data warehouse in this article. To accommodate the limited health data of poor nations like Bangladesh, we have developed privacy-preserving secured record linkage architecture we call Secured Health Data Handler (SHDH). For the purpose of facilitating the knowledge discovery process, our approach may anonymize identifying private data of patients while preserving record linkage in integrated health repositories. Even without a standard ID, our suggested strategy was able to connect records with sufficient accuracy for noisy data, according to the experimental results.  © 2024 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198902714"

The centralized nature of current health information systems leads to single points of failure, making the data vulnerable to cyberattacks. Patients also have little control over their medical records, raising privacy concerns. Blockchain technology presents a promising solution to these challenges through its decentralized, transparent, and immutable properties. This research proposes ZeroTrustBlock, a comprehensive blockchain framework for secure and private health information exchange. The decentralized ledger enhances integrity, while permissioned access and smart contracts enable patient-centric control over medical data sharing. A hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage model balances transparency with confidentiality. Integration gateways bridge ZeroTrustBlock protocols with existing systems like EHRs. Implemented on Hyperledger Fabric, ZeroTrustBlock demonstrates substantial security improvements over mainstream databases via cryptographic mechanisms, formal privacy-preserving protocols, and access policies enacting patient consent. Results validate the architecture’s effectiveness in achieving 14,200 TPS average throughput, 480 ms average latency for 100,000 concurrent transactions, and linear scalability up to 20 nodes. However, enhancements around performance, advanced cryptography, and real-world pilots are future work.

As the number of personal health records (PHRs) increases, concerns about data privacy, security, and interoperability emerge, highlighting the need for standardized data integration with secured record linkage, privacy preservation, and quality control in research and analytical platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Blockchain-based Patient Record Linkage System (BlockPRLS) for Big Data Analytics, leveraging confidentiality, integrity, and availability with a secured shared mechanism of PHRs. Moreover, the proposed solution significantly mitigates data gaps among operational health information systems (HIS) and clinical research infrastructure in low- and mid-income countries; where the international data standardization methods (e.g., LOINC, SONMED CT, OMOP Common Data Model) are not followed. Our extended framework presents a detailed architecture of a blockchain platform connecting with a mobile app- B2MAppH that connects patients, doctors, telehealth, and HIS, potentially able to transfer anonymous health records into the Central Data Repository (CDR) of a big data infrastructure. B2MappH is integrated with CDR, maintaining the privacy of the patient. It has been implemented in a private blockchain environment. Therefore, it provides an efficient solution for storing, linking, and sharing patient data, enabling better care coordination, big data research, and outcomes. Experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the system for both personal healthcare and big data analytics support.  © 2024 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204100917"

User-centered evidence-based medical information for patients positively influences therapy success, behavior, and cause–effect comprehension. Also, improved health literacy allows patients to accept medical advice and share decision-making and improves doctor–patient communication. Today, CHISs exist in many different forms. Yet, information is generally provided statically, i.e., the same medical content is presented to everyone. However, patients vary regarding previous knowledge and information needs and preference of perception of the information, e.g., in textual or visual form. This variation can depend, e.g., on gender, age, personality, perception, and cognitive aspects. In this conceptual chapter, we envision how research and knowledge from evidence-based medical knowledge, cognitive-psychological mechanisms, and interactive data visualizations can be combined, to form adaptive and interactive consumer health information systems (CHISs) that take account of individual health information needs and increase health literacy by providing a reliable source of medical knowledge. To this end, we detail the scope and contributions of these disciplines to novel visual health information systems which can adapt them to the information needs and preferences of their consumers. We depict a concept for an advanced interactive, adaptive, personalized visual CHIS (named A CHIS). The concept is based on introducing multidimensional adaptivity in the content, visual presentation, level of detail, for example, to the provision of evidence-based medical health information, aiming at the consumers’ full understanding of the meaning of the provided medical content. We argue that adaptive visual health information may provide efficiency increase for the general medical system and improved health literacy. While we do not present concrete results, we lay out the research opportunities and a possible system architecture to inform and implement ACHIS in the future. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195349089"

However, integrating them into health information systems (HISs) introduces challenges beyond clinical decision making, such as interoperability and diverse electronic health records (EHR) formats. We proposed Model Cabinet Architecture (MoCab), a framework designed to leverage fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR) as the standard for data storage and retrieval when deploying machine learning models across various HISs, addressing the challenges highlighted by platforms such as EPOCH®, ePRISM®, KETOS, and others. Methods: The MoCab architecture is designed to streamline predictive modeling in healthcare through a structured framework incorporating several specialized parts. The Data Service Center manages patient data retrieval from FHIR servers. These data are then processed by the Knowledge Model Center, where they are formatted and fed into predictive models. The Model Retraining Center is crucial in continuously updating these models to maintain accuracy in dynamic clinical environments. The framework further incorporates Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Hooks for issuing clinical alerts. It uses Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies (SMART) on FHIR to develop applications for displaying alerts, prediction results, and patient records. Results: The MoCab framework was demonstrated using three types of predictive models: a scoring model (qCSI), a machine learning model (NSTI), and a deep learning model (SPC), applied to synthetic data that mimic a major EHR system. The implementations showed how MoCab integrates predictive models with health data for clinical decision support, utilizing CDS Hooks and SMART on FHIR for seamless HIS integration. The demonstration confirmed the practical utility of MoCab in supporting clinical decision making, validated by its application in various healthcare settings. Conclusions: We demonstrate MoCab's potential in promoting the interoperability of machine learning models and enhancing its utility across various EHRs. Despite facing challenges like FHIR adoption, MoCab addresses key challenges in adapting machine learning models within healthcare settings, paving the way for further enhancements and broader adoption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199924957"

The government of Dubai launched a mass campaign in December 2020 to vaccinate all its citizens and residents, targeting the population aged >18 years against COVID-19. The vaccination campaign involved a transformation of multiple commercial spaces into mass vaccination centers across the city of Dubai, the largest of which was the Dubai One Central (DOC) vaccination center. It was operational between January 17, 2021, and 27 January 27, 2022. Objective: The multiphase research study aims to empirically explore the opinions of multiple health care stakeholders, elicit the key success factors that can influence the effective delivery of emergency health care services such as a COVID-19 mass vaccination center, and explore how these factors relate to one another. Methods: To understand more about the operations of the DOC vaccination center, the study follows a multiphase design divided into 2 phases. The study is being conducted by the Institute for Excellence in Health Professions Education at Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences between December 2021 and January 2023. To elicit the key success factors that contributed to the vaccination campaign administered at DOC, the research team conducted 30 semistructured interviews (SSIs) with a sample of staff and volunteers who worked at the DOC vaccination center. Stratified random sampling was used to select the participants, and the interview cohort included representatives from the management team, team leaders, the administration and registration team, vaccinators, and volunteers. A total of 103 people were invited to take part in the research study, and 30 agreed to participate in the SSIs. To validate the participation of various stakeholders, phase 2 will analytically investigate one’s subjectivity through Q-methodology and empirically investigate the opinions obtained from the research participants during phase 1. Results: As of July 2022, 30 SSIs were conducted with the research participants. Conclusions: The study will provide a comprehensive 2-phase approach to obtaining the key success factors that can influence the delivery of high-quality health care services such as emergency services launched during a global pandemic. The study’s findings will be translated into key factors that could support designing future health care services utilizing evidence-based practice. In line with future plans, a study will use data, collected through the DOC vaccination center, to develop a simulation model outlining the process of the customer journey and center workflow. © Hayette Faroun, Nabil Zary, Khalifa Baqer, Farida Alkhaja, Kareem Gad, Mohamad Alameddine, Hanan Al Suwaidi.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158911146"

When considering that Brazil has more than 210 million people, it is noted that the SUS, with a annual budget (2022) of US$ 31B is the largest public and free health system in the world. To manage all care provided by SUS in health centers and posts, hospitals, laboratories, and blood centers, including; and the Health Surveillance, Epidemiological Surveillance, Environmental Surveillance services, in addition to foundations and academic and scientific research institutes, the Ministry of Health (MS) makes use of more than 300 technological platforms. However, despite the existence of all these systems, there is still no characterization of this platforms from the perspective of computational architecture of Health Information Systems (HIS).

Healthcare providers experience many problems with their HISs due to improper architecture design. To support the design of a proper HIS architecture, a reference architecture (RA) can be used that meets the various stakeholder concerns of HISs. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop and analyze an RA following well-established architecture design methods. Methods: Domain analysis was performed to scope and model the domain of HISs. For the architecture design, we applied the views and beyond approach and designed the RA’s views based on the stakeholders and features from the domain analysis. We evaluated the RA with a case study. Results: We derived the following four architecture views for HISs: The context diagram, decomposition view, layered view, and deployment view. Each view shows the architecture of the HIS from a different angle, suitable for various stakeholders. Based on a Japanese hospital information system study, we applied the RA and derived the application architecture. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the methods of the software architecture design community could be used in the healthcare domain effectively and showed the applicability of the RA. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109665310"

However, data collection and reporting within ERUs have been time-consuming and paper-based. The Red Cross Red Crescent Health Information System (RCHIS) was developed to improve clinical documentation and reporting, ensuring accuracy and ease of use while increasing compliance with reporting standards. Case presentation: RCHIS is an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and Health Information System (HIS) designed for RCRC ERUs. It can be accessed on Android tablets or Windows laptops, both online and offline. The system securely stores data on Microsoft Azure cloud, with synchronization facilitated through a local ERU server. The functional architecture covers all clinical functions of ERU clinics and hospitals, incorporating user-friendly features. A pilot study was conducted with the Portuguese Red Cross (PRC) during a large-scale event. Thirteen super users were trained and subsequently trained the staff. During the four-day pilot, 77 user accounts were created, and 243 patient files were documented. Feedback indicated that RCHIS was easy to use, requiring minimal training time, and had sufficient training for full utilization. Real-time reporting facilitated coordination with the civil defense authority. Conclusions: The development and pilot use of RCHIS demonstrated its feasibility and efficacy within RCRC ERUs. The system addressed the need for an EMR and HIS solution, enabling comprehensive clinical documentation and supporting administrative reporting functions. The pilot study validated the training of trainers’ approach and paved the way for further domestic use of RCHIS. RCHIS has the potential to improve patient safety, quality of care, and reporting efficiency within ERUs. Automated reporting reduces the burden on ERU leadership, while electronic compilation enhances record completeness and correctness. Ongoing feedback collection and feature development continue to enhance RCHIS’s functionality. Further trainings took place in 2023 and preparations for international deployments are under way. RCHIS represents a significant step toward improved emergency medical care and coordination within the RCRC and has implications for similar systems in other Emergency Medical Teams. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189949210"

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), digital health information exchange between healthcare institutions is almost non-existent due to many reasons including non-standardized health record format, insufficient network infrastructure, and non-interoperable health information systems. Although most healthcare institutions have their own digital patient record system, those systems lack standardized interfaces with others. Those contributed to the slowdown in HIE development in the region. In such environments, microservices architecture can be used to design resilient systems so the development of scalable and interoperable health information exchange is possible. In this article, we propose an approach that utilizes the microservices architecture [1] paradigm along with enterprise architecture (EA) in developing interoperable HIEs within such environments. © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133173238"

Patients often undergo examinations in various medical institutions, and since their results are often handed out to the patient in printed form, the receiving institution transfers them to its database manually. There is also a tendency to completely refuse analog media and use only digital ones. But in this case, another problem appears-either loss or conversion of the accumulated analog base into digital format. These days, automatic document management systems for medical institutions-Health information systems (HIS)-are actively developing. The software module developed in accordance with the architecture described in the article can be used by developers of various HIS to automate the work with analog data. If it is necessary, it can also be freely expanded by adding new modules for working with various analog data. In this article, we take ECG scans and medical test results as examples of such data.

In addition to overblown budgets and elapsed deadlines (ad nauseam), technical issues exist. These include poor usability, instability, system performance, and data inconsistency issues. The issues relate to Software Engineering, and specifically Software Architecture. The role of Software Architecture underpins these issues. However, the enquiries and analyses of these failed Information Systems projects have focused on the perspective of stakeholders (e.g., government ministers and health practitioners) and project managers. While stakeholders provide input into project requirements and goals, the project failure or success does not emanate from these roles exclusively. For example, system instability is not specifically a stakeholder issue but rather a Software Architecture concern. Aim: To bring to bear and address public sector health Information System failure from the Software Architecture perspective. Method: A literature survey was conducted to ascertain the perceived failure and success factors within the public health domain. Results: We observed that the available literature on health Information Systems appears to lack success factors which have been noted in the Software Engineering and Software Architecture literature. Software Architecture appears to be an understudied area within the public health domain. Contribution: To bring awareness to the public health domain that the Information System's success requires multi-faceted perspectives and actions. Specifically, perspectives and actions involving Software Architects and Software Engineers are required to successfully address the quality attributes of the proposed systems during development.

Such technologies of using IoT and remote patient monitoring systems have become dramatically fundamental to reduce the movement of patients, and hence reducing the risk of spreading Covid-19 infection. The Ministry of Health in the Kingdom of Bahrain strives to achieve digital transformation in the healthcare industry, where the National Health Information System (I-SEHA) was launched to provide higher-quality health services. The system interconnects the public healthcare institutes, allowing access to patient’s data from any location without the hassle of moving the files physically. Digitization of medical data of patients and sharing some of the data with other institutions outside the protected networks may lead to major privacy and integrity concerns. This paper introduces Blockchain-based Zero-Knowledge Proof (BZKP) model, which is an IoT-based patient-centric model that fuses a zero-knowledge proof solution to be developed for protecting patient’s privacy, and ensures patients prior consent on any access to their data including their health status and account balance. The proposed model is developed to provide a robust and scalable architecture for data sharing, which protects the privacy of sensitive data while maintaining high availability. It also provides strong trust and integrity of data by using the immutability features of the blockchain. BZKP is based on pre-approved blockchain access tokens to address challenges of accountability and privacy in Bahrain smart cities. As a result, the model provides a secure and trusted access model between different stakeholders to share patient data while maintaining privacy, trust, and high availability. The zero-knowledge proof can be used with the smart contracts, which provides programmable actions that can be used for automating the prescriptions dispensation process for private pharmacies in a decentralized manner with high confidence. Finally, it recommends enhanced electronic key (eKey) procedures used by eGovernment of the Kingdom of Bahrain to update the smart card which stores the personal keys for protecting patient’s privacy and provide better consent. © 2021 The Author(s).

Interoperability, in the context of this article, is “the ability to share information across time and space from multiple devices, sources, and organizations,” as defined by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers). This is followed by recommendations for future policy work toward improving the standardization of heterogeneous data in the healthcare setting. Methodology: A literature review was conducted on established interoperability systems in healthcare based on information obtained from journal publications, government and academy reports, published materials, and publicly available websites. Examples of interoperable solutions adapted to systems were provided at three levels of healthcare interoperability, as defined by the National Academy of Medicine: inter-facility interoperability, intra-facility interoperability, and point-of-care interoperability. Results: This review reveals that adopting existing interoperability standards to clinical settings, even when prudent and tailored to a specific application, may lack scalability. Broader tasks in interoperability require customized solutions in conjunction with standards adapted to each health information system’s infrastructure and objectives. Conclusions: The development of custom solutions may be simplified under the recent development of the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) framework, which greatly reduces data exchange friction in many healthcare contexts. In addition, funding middleware architectures to mediate data exchange between separate healthcare organizations may also be an effective strategy for consolidating healthcare data and improving information exchange. © 2023.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199774794"

While IS scholarship has a rich tradition of research on developing and implementing digital artefacts within intra-organisational contexts, our understanding of knowledge integration across distributed innovation networks is nascent and under-theorised. This is an important area of research given the rising importance of digital innovation networks and the challenges faced in integrating specialised knowledge, especially given the greater diversity, speed, reach, and scope made possible by digital technologies. Drawing on in-depth case study findings from a health IoT project involving multiple organisations and disciplines, we explore how knowledge is integrated across boundaries during the initiation stage of a digital innovation network. Our findings point to boundaries related to the digital platform's organising vision, resource allocation, delivery roadmap, technical architecture, and intellectual property, to name but a few challenges. We then reveal five socio-cognitive modes of knowledge integration which actors strategically enact to cross syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic boundaries: Signalling, Assembling, Contesting, Discounting, and Finalising. The choice of mode depends on the perceived knowledge status (‘what they know’) and social status (‘who they are’) of network actors, which highlight the salience of both social and cognitive dependencies for knowledge integration. We further discuss the contribution of design objects for overcoming differences and distinctions between specialist actors in a digital innovation network. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206988838"

Objectives: To present the author's personal views on HIS developments over the last decades and on the opportunities and priorities for future HIS developments. Methods: Reflecting on his views, the author identified relevant semantic dimensions, which are denoted as development paths, and searched for appropriate periods to characterize HIS development leaps. Results: HIS developments were divided into the periods past (1961-2016), present (2017-2022), and future (the next decades). Eight development paths for HIS were considered as being relevant to presenting the author's views: life situations related to health care, entities for health care, health care facilities, settings of health care, data to be processed, features for functions, architectures of HIS, and management of HIS. For each of these paths, the past and present states as well as challenges and opportunities for future HIS developments were outlined. Discussion and Conclusions: The presented views on HIS developments and the selected development paths and periods are by nature subjective â€ avant la lettreâ€ . The views were, however, formed over almost half a century during which the author has been engaged with HIS developments, and thus may be worth reporting and discussion. If past is prologue, the tremendous HIS developments in the past and in the present may predict a similar development intensity in the future. Present HIS are significantly better than HIS of the past, however they leave room for continued improvement with an end of HIS developments far from sight. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140932591"

However, these investments have also raised issues related to the lack of use of open models for representing clinical data, unclear directives to decide what health information system is the most appropriate for each scenario, and subjective points of view on how to design optimal health information infrastructures. In this chapter, we discuss our experiences about the adoption of openEHR at national scale and its connection with research on how evidence can be built to make well-informed decisions about the adoption of health information systems. We cover both technical and human challenges found when approaching national health information architectures, and we describe our future vision on how evidence-based biomedical informatics should help decision makers in the design of biomedical data management architectures. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

It has also become costly to health-care institutions to maintain these fragmented, standalone systems. This study examined how enterprise architecture (EA) can be applied to guide the integration of health information systems (HISs) in the Namibian health-care context. A qualitative approach was applied to collect data from two cases using semi structured interviews and an interpretive approach in the analysis. From the analysis, the constructs of requirements clarity, information systems and technology (IS/T) project management, systems documentation, and communication were discovered to influence the development and integration of HISs. Applying these constructs, the study developed an EA guide for the development and integration of HISs. The study recommends that future studies consider developing similar architecture using a quantitative approach and possibly validating the developed guide using a quantitative approach. © 2025 IGI Global.

The reliability of HIT systems in this regard is critical to patient safety. Consequently, better tools are needed to monitor the performance of HIT systems for potential hazards that could compromise the collected EHRs, which in turn could affect patient safety. In this paper, we propose a new framework for detecting anomalies in EHRs using sequence of clinical events. This new framework, EHR-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), is motivated by the gaps in the existing deep-learning related methods, including high false negatives, sub-optimal accuracy, higher computational cost, and the risk of information loss. EHR-BERT is an innovative framework rooted in the BERT architecture, meticulously tailored to navigate the hurdles in the contemporary BERT method; thus, enhancing anomaly detection in EHRs for healthcare applications. Methods: The EHR-BERT framework was designed using the Sequential Masked Token Prediction (SMTP) method. This approach treats EHRs as natural language sentences and iteratively masks input tokens during both training and prediction stages. This method facilitates the learning of EHR sequence patterns in both directions for each event and identifies anomalies based on deviations from the normal execution models trained on EHR sequences. Results: Extensive experiments on large EHR datasets across various medical domains demonstrate that EHR-BERT markedly improves upon existing models. It significantly reduces the number of false positives and enhances the detection rate, thus bolstering the reliability of anomaly detection in electronic health records. This improvement is attributed to the model's ability to minimize information loss and maximize data utilization effectively. Conclusion: EHR-BERT showcases immense potential in decreasing medical errors related to anomalous clinical events, positioning itself as an indispensable asset for enhancing patient safety and the overall standard of healthcare services. The framework effectively overcomes the drawbacks of earlier models, making it a promising solution for healthcare professionals to ensure the reliability and quality of health data. © 2024","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184153295"

Data sharing between actors, and the speed and content of data flows, is essential for expediting epidemic response. In this study, researchers mapped data flows during the 2018 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo using semi-structured interviews, ethnographic research, and focus groups with EVD response actors. During this research, we mapped and tracked data collection, transmission, storage, sharing, and use patterns. Target participants included: key organizational actors in the EVD outbreaks responses, including local (primary health, community-based, hospital), provincial (MoPH, DRC Red Cross), and international (WHO, UN organizations, international first-responders) stakeholders. We found that a community-based surveillance system enabled the rapid detection of a hemorrhagic fever outbreak, resulting in the rapid laboratory confirmation of EVD. With the arrival of international organizations to provide support to the EVD response, routine surveillance systems continued to function robustly. However, the establishment of a vertical EVD response architecture created challenges for the response. Data flows during the Equateur outbreak were hampered by numerous challenges in the domains of early warning, line lists of cases, and contact tracing, which impeded surveillance and data flows. We therefore argue that structuring health information systems for preparedness requires taking a person-centered approach to data production, flow, and analysis. © 2022","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146009805"

To resolve these dilemmas, we propose and justify a novel, globally scalable reference architecture for a Personal Health Data Space (PHDS). This architecture leverages decentralized content-addressable storage (DCAS) networks, ensuring that the data subject retains complete control and ownership of their personal health data. In today's globalized world, where people are increasingly mobile for work and leisure, healthcare is transitioning from episodic symptom-based treatment toward continuity of care. The main aims of this are patient engagement, illness prevention, and active and healthy longevity. This shift, along with the secondary use of health data for societal benefit, has intensified the challenges associated with health data accessibility, comprehensiveness, and ownership. Method: The study is structured around four health data use case scenarios from the Estonian National Health Information System (EHIS): primary medical use, medical emergency use, secondary use, and personal use. We analyze these use cases from the perspectives of accessibility, comprehensiveness, and ownership. Additionally, we examine the security, privacy, and interoperability aspects of health data. Results: The proposed architectural solution allows individuals to consolidate all their health data into a unified Personal Health Record (PHR). This data can come from various healthcare institutions, mobile applications, medical devices for home use, and personal health notes. Discussions: The comprehensive PHR can then be shared with healthcare providers in a semantically interoperable manner, regardless of their location or the information systems they use. Furthermore, individuals maintain the autonomy to share, sell, or donate their anonymous or pseudonymous health data for secondary use with different systems worldwide. The proposed reference architecture aligns with the principles of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) initiative, enhancing health data management by providing a secure, cost-effective, and sustainable solution.

Since then, countries have moved rapidly to digitise their health information systems. Soon, however, most governments who adopted digitisation began encountering challenges with interoperability hampering timely and accurate decision-making. The Asia eHealth Information Network was created by WHO in 2011 to form a group of peers collaborating to solve this interoperability problem. After 9 years of continuous knowledge exchange and resource sharing, AeHIN has arrived at a framework to guide countries in developing their national eHealth programme. This framework is the ‘Mind the GAPS’ approach. GAPS is an acronym representing the foundational importance of multisectoral governance (G) in setting the strategy and directions for eHealth development in the country. This governance structure then broadly promotes a shared enterprise architecture (A) with stakeholders who in turn adopt good programme management (P) practices to build their part of the blueprint. By implementing the standards (S) in the blueprint, stakeholders contribute to interoperability within a country and corollary, to the region. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

There have been many tasks focused on extracting relevant information from clinical texts, however, no previous task has been centered on radiology using Spanish as the main language. Detecting relevant information automatically in biomedical texts is a crucial task because current health information systems are not prepared to analyze and extract this knowledge due to the time and cost involved in processing it manually. To accomplish this task, we propose two approaches based on pre-trained models using the BERT architecture. Specifically, we use a multi-class classification model, a binary classification model and a pipeline model for entity identification. The results are encouraging since we improved the average of the participants by obtaining a 73.7% F1-score using the binary system. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

However, its intricate architecture often obscures the decision-making process, creating a “black box” that hinders trust and limits its potential. This lack of transparency poses significant challenges, particularly in critical fields like the healthcare system. We present OntoXAI, a Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) based Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach to address these challenges. OntoXAI leverages semantic technology and machine learning (ML) to enhance prediction accuracy and generate user-comprehensible natural language explanations in the context of dengue disease classification. OntoXAI can be summarized into three key aspects. (1) Creates a knowledge base that incorporates domain-specific knowledge related to the disease. This allows for the integration of expert knowledge into the classification process. (2) OntoXAI presents a diagnostic classification system that utilizes patient symptoms as input to classify the disease accurately. By leveraging ML algorithms, it achieves high accuracy in disease classification. (3) OntoXAI introduces SWRL and ontology to integrate explainable AI techniques with Open AI API, enabling a better understanding of the classification process. By combining the power of machine learning algorithms with the ability to provide transparent, human-understandable explanations through Open AI API, this approach offers several advantages in enhancing prediction accuracy, achieving levels of up to 96%. Overall, OntoXAI represents a significant advancement in the field of explainable AI, addressing the challenges of transparency and trust in machine learning systems, particularly in critical domains like healthcare. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200653019"

One of the results of this transformation is the gradual virtualization of care. Irrespective of the care environment, trust between caregivers and patients is essential for achieving favorable health outcomes. Given the many breaches of information security and patient safety, today's health information system portfolios do not suffice as infrastructure for establishing and maintaining trust in virtual care environments. Objective: This study aims to establish a theoretical foundation for a complex health care system intervention that aims to exploit a cryptographically secured infrastructure for establishing and maintaining trust in virtualized care environments and, based on this theoretical foundation, present a proof of concept that fulfills the necessary requirements. Methods: This work applies the following framework for the design and evaluation of complex intervention research within health care: a review of the literature and expert consultation for technology forecasting. A proof of concept was developed by following the principles of design science and requirements engineering. Results: This study determined and defined the crucial functional and nonfunctional requirements and principles for enhancing trust between caregivers and patients within a virtualized health care environment. The cornerstone of our architecture is an approach that uses blockchain technology. The proposed decentralized system offers an innovative governance structure for a novel trust model. The presented theoretical design principles are supported by a concrete implementation of an Ethereum-based platform called VerifyMed. Conclusions: A service for enhancing trust in a virtualized health care environment that is built on a public blockchain has a high fit for purpose in Healthcare 4.0. © Anton Hasselgren, Jens-Andreas Hanssen Rensaa, Katina Kralevska, Danilo Gligoroski, Arild Faxvaag.

However, building and deploying MFL is a formidable challenge given the various socio-technical complexities. The theory of information infrastructures, which deal with large-scale, complex and distributed systems, provides guidance on how to approach such complexities. This paper suggests that Indian MFL has failed to create the heterogeneous socio-technical network around it, and been unsuccessful in creating value for initial group of users and subsequently building growth momentum. Also, it failed in making itself adaptable to different applications and use contexts. Three sets of recommendation for its improvement include enabling governance structure, adopting flexible design architecture and making active efforts to promote MFL use. © 2023 Economic and Political Weekly.

This involves the use of an electronic health record (EHR) which is a longitudinal electronic record of a patient’s information. The EHR includes all the patient’s encounters that have been made with different health facilities. In the national context, the EHR is also known as a national EHR, which enables the sharing of patient information between points of care. However, a lack of interoperability exists between many South African health information systems making communication between these disparate systems impossible. As a result, the sharing of patient information is inhibited and the benefit of improving healthcare delivery cannot be realised. This paper proposes a system architecture for addressing interoperability challenges and indicates how interoperability can be ensured in a national EHR system. The proposed system architecture is differentiated from other national EHR system architectures found in the literature in order to emphasise its novelty. Secondary data obtained from a systematic literature review was analysed using content analysis, resulting in 9482 tags which informed the development of the proposed system architecture.

The flexible acquisition of cloud-native architecture requires organizations to invest additional resources. How to plan and formulate resource input is a topic of common concern for public health management and information systems. According to the commercial characteristics of the public health system based on cloud-native architecture, this paper systematically analyzes the external major impact factors and auxiliary factors that affect the flexible cost investment strategy of cloud providers and combines flexible investment strategies to build a cloud-native cost investment model. Finally, case data in practice is applied into the model, and cost planning is discussed according to different situations. The findings indicate that (1) the more cloud providers adopt the changed flexible strategy, the more conducive it is to reduce costs; (2) the larger the application load, the more cloud providers need to use flexible strategies to lower costs; (3) the less the impact of changing the flexible strategy on costs, the more conducive cloud providers use the flexible strategy to decrease costs; (4) the more uneven the distribution of diversity, the higher proportion of investment increases than the proportion of investment, and the more cloud providers consider the investment using flexible strategy. The results of the discussion provide a reference for public health organizations to use flexible strategies and change flexible strategies in a timely manner and expand the research scope of information system cost investment. © 2021 Ming Jiang et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100257788"

Objective: To determine the number of headache disorder consult requests to a neurology outpatient service in a tertiary medical center, the appropriateness of the consult requests, and the effectiveness of a lecture series on headache diagnosis and management in preventing inappropriate consult requests from non-neurology providers. Methods: Clinical data on US Veterans is captured and documented in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA). The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) electronic medical record (EMR) was used for data entry and retrieval. All consult requests for the study period within the VA North Texas Health Care System were identified in VISTA, and the clinical information reviewed in CPRS. Based on a defined algorithm, headache consult request were categorized as appropriate or inappropriate. A board-certified neurologist provided four in-person/virtual lectures to ambulatory care providers, primary care providers, internal medicine residents, and emergency room providers within the VA North Texas Health Care System on the diagnosis and management of headaches. Prior and post the lecture series, the total number of headache consults per day was assessed over 45-day periods. Results: The number of daily headache consult requests in the 45-day period prior to the lecture series was 3.6 per day (standard deviation 2.7), and 6.0 per day after the lecture series (standard deviation 2.1). The difference was not statistically significant. There were as many inappropriate headache consult requests after the lecture series as appropriate ones (50% each). Conclusion: We found that a short-term educational initiative that instructed primary care providers on the diagnosis and management of common headache disorders did not reduce the number of consultation requests and, surprisingly, it did not improve the appropriateness of the consults. Given the prevalence of headaches in the general population, better training of all primary care providers in headache management should be pursued. © The Author(s) 2022.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156102855"

Selecting appropriate terminologies is a universal concern for HTS stakeholders. The purpose of this study is to develop a framework for HTS selection. To do this, the study was designed in two stages: I) Developing an initial framework by running a systematic literature review (reviewing 100 articles selected based on the criteria from 10886 articles retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE), and II) Validation of the initial framework by the use of a modified Delphi Method (2 rounds). The proposed framework comprised four dimensions: terminology main group (TMG), important related terminologies (IRTs), message exchange standards (MES), and architecture of terminology standards (ATS). TMG includes “the committee for terminology selection”, “determination of the scope coverage”, and “requirement evaluation”. IRTs used during the creation and maintenance of terminologies for mapping purposes are classified into two groups: 1) administrative, financial and legal terminologies, and 2) clinical terminologies. The steps for applying MES for TMG include 1) need assessment for MES based on the objectives and scope of TMG, 2) reviewing MES at the national and international level, 3) choosing/developing the MES standard(s). Finally, the proposed ATS includes TMG, IRTs, health information systems, and standard-based programs like registries, and data-warehouses. The framework could be used as a foundation for policy-makers, and vendors to: 1) attain the goals of semantic interoperability, 2) ensure high-quality data exchange, and 3) increase data reusability. © 2022","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130565703"

The biggest drawback of the HL7 CDA document-based approach is the timing of sharing the information. The document is generally shared once all the agreed data elements have been precisely filled in and the necessary confirmations received. Today, Estonia is transitioning the Estonian National Health Information System (ENHIS) from a document-based approach to an event-based approach by utilising the HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. During this transition, one of the tasks is to describe the patient's socioeconomic status according to the FHIR profile.Method: As part of the project, the CDA-based notification of infectious patients, including patients' socioeconomic status, in the Infectious Disease Information System (NAKIS - the acronym of the system in Estonian) of Estonia is analysed. This analysis pays special attention to education and employment data, which is currently part of patients' socioeconomic status. The existing employment and education-related FHIR profiles, openEHR clinical models and SNOMED and LOINC terminology are studied to find appropriate specifications for patients' socioeconomic status.Results: As a result of the project, similar and/or suitable FHIR resources and terminology will be chosen. Structural changes will be made in the data collection process, where several simple values will be selected instead of one complex value. New FHIR profiles will be created, modelling new FHIR-based data structures and describing the terminology.Summary: It is possible to reuse information from existing official sources rather than collect it from patients. Socioeconomic status is a temporal representation of the patient's education, employment and other similar information about the patient. We propose a universal and reusable methodology for migrating HL7 CDA documents and their components into FHIR resources.  © 2023 Owner/Author(s).","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162857522"

Achieving this requires accurate and timely health workforce information. This informed the development of the Nigeria Health Workforce Registry (NHWR) based on the global, regional, and national strategies for strengthening the HRH towards achieving universal health coverage. This case study describes the process of conceptualizing and establishing the NHWR, and discusses the strategies for developing sustainable and scalable health workforce registries. Case presentation: In designing the NHWR, a review of existing national HRH policies and guidelines, as well as reports of previous endeavors was done to learn what had been done previously and obtain the views of stakeholders on how to develop a scalable and sustainable registry. The findings indicated the need to review the architecture of the registry to align with other health information systems, develop a standardized data set and guidance documents for the registry including a standard operating procedure to ensure that a holistic process is adopted in data collection, management and use nationally. Learning from the findings, a conceptual framework was developed, a registry managed centrally by the Federal Ministry of Health was developed and decentralized, a standardized tool based on a national minimum data was developed and adopted nationally, a registry prototype was developed using iHRIS Manage and the registry governance functions were integrated into the health information system governance structures. To sustain the functionality of the NHWR, the handbook of the NHWR that comprised of an implementation guide, the standard operating procedure, and the basic user training manual was developed and the capacity of government staff was built on the operations of the registry. Conclusion: In establishing a functional and sustainable registry, learning from experiences is essential in shaping acceptable, sustainable, and scalable approaches. Instituting governance structures that include and involve policymakers, health managers and users is of great importance in the design, planning, implementation, and decentralization stages. In addition, developing standardized tools based on the health system's needs and instituting supportable mechanisms for data flow and use for policy, planning, development, and management is essential. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122921256"

This promise will be difficult to attain without interoperability: facilitating seamless health information exchange between the deployed digital health information systems (HIS). Objective To determine the maturity readiness of the interoperability capacity of Kenya's HIS. Methods We used the HIS Interoperability Maturity Toolkit, developed by MEASURE Evaluation and the Health Data Collaborative's Digital Health and Interoperability Working Group. The assessment was undertaken by eHealth stakeholder representatives primarily from the Ministry of Health's Digital Health Technical Working Group. The toolkit focused on three major domains: leadership and governance, human resources and technology. Results Most domains are at the lowest two levels of maturity: nascent or emerging. At the nascent level, HIS activities happen by chance or represent isolated, ad hoc efforts. An emerging maturity level characterises a system with defined HIS processes and structures. However, such processes are not systematically documented and lack ongoing monitoring mechanisms. Conclusion None of the domains had a maturity level greater than level 2 (emerging). The subdomains of governance structures for HIS, defined national enterprise architecture for HIS, defined technical standards for data exchange, nationwide communication network infrastructure, and capacity for operations and maintenance of hardware attained higher maturity levels. These findings are similar to those from interoperability maturity assessments done in Ghana and Uganda. © ","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110266279"
